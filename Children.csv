Meet Bingo and J'miah, raccoon brothers on a mission to save Sugar Man Swamp in this rollicking tale and National Book Award Finalist from Newbery Honoree Kathi Appelt.
Raccoon brothers Bingo and J'miah are the newest recruits of the Official Sugar Man Swamp Scouts. The opportunity to serve the Sugar Man--the massive creature who delights in delicious sugar cane and magnanimously rules over the swamp--is an honor, and also a big responsibility, since the rest of the swamp critters rely heavily on the intel of these hardworking Scouts.
Twelve-year-old Chap Brayburn is not a member of any such organization. But he loves the swamp something fierce, and he'll do anything to help protect it.
And help is surely needed, because world-class alligator wrestler Jaeger Stitch wants to turn Sugar Man swamp into an Alligator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park, and the troubles don't end there. There is also a gang of wild feral hogs on the march, headed straight toward them all.

And the characterizations were similarly distinguished. I thought the mix of chapter lengths worked to really zip things along, and the large mix of POVs were pretty seamlessly woven together. Very distinguished. But my God, the pacing was weird. It zipped, but to what? Nothing happened. I felt like it was doing a great job of building to something, and it never actually did.

Every classroom needs a book like this one to amuse students and to help the teacher get her vocal chords limbered up for the day. Who cares whether there is a message here--although yes, it\'s easy to see that this one serves up a message about an unexpected friendship--the words are so much fun to say and hear, and the images entice readers to take a second look at the shapes on the pictures. Teachers or parents planning to share this title with others--and you definitely will want to do so--should definitely read it aloud a couple of times ahead of time for a smoother performance later on. I read it to my cats and dog and then my own students, to their great delight. I think the cats just liked the sound of my voice.

(""Around, round hound. Around, greyhound."") The pace picks up (""Around and around and astound and astound""), until they ultimately wear themselves out.

This book has since been a popular favorite among children and has won the Caldecott Honor Book Award for its excellence in writing and in its drawing. Strega Nona is sure to be a hit with both children and adults. \n Tomie dePaola does an awesome job at creating a story that is humorous and exciting at the same time. Big Anthony humorously plays the role of a tragic hero as he at first was able to feed the townspeople all the pasta they desired, but then ends up nearly destroying the town when he did not listen to Strega Nona\'s warnings about the pasta pot. Strega Nona also acted as a savior to the people when she saved the town from the pasta and therefore saving their lives. Tomie dePaola\'s illustrations are simply delightful as he illustrates Strega Nona as a helpful and intelligent old woman with an old-fashioned apron around her and Big Anthony as a big and klutzy man who seems to have wild blond hair. \n ""Strega Nona"" is a wonderful story about the consequences of not listening to certain warnings that could endanger people\'s lives. Also, this book shows the importance of respecting one\'s elders as the villagers respect Strega Nona\'s wisdom on cures and life.

The books come across as overly quirky or weird, the characters are extremely flat, or the plot just isn't there. That was until I read Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library. \n Chris Grabenstein's children's novel Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library is a fun, modern Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It captures the fun innocence of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory without being what could only be defined as a knock-off version. \n Reading Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library you will notice similar elements to the favored children's novel. There is the quirky, reclusive 'inventor' of sorts - Mr. Lemoncello, who can only be described as having the heart of a child and an obsession with reading. There is a huge modern library that has room after room filled with games, books, educational material, and lots of fun. And of course, there is the competition amongst grade-school children for the ultimate prize. \n Chris Grabenstein could have easily taken these elements and mirrored them to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but he didn't. He made them his own. Yes, there are certain elements that are extremely similar, but they are unique enough that you don't feel like you are reading a poor attempt at creating a hit children's novel. \n Now, you are probably wondering just how interesting a book can be when it takes place in a library. This is no ordinary library. There are virtual reality games, holographic images that can talk and interact with people, and lots of hidden passageways and secret rooms to be found. \n There are two things I absolutely loved about Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library - the games and books! Even as an adult, I loved playing along with the game that the children in the book were playing. Some of the clues were obviously meant for young readers, but it was still fun. It gave the book a nice interactive feel without requiring me to use a computer or head to a website to play along (an all too common theme with children's books that try to be interactive). \n Another element I loved was the book aspect. Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library mentions several novels across all genres throughout the novel. I love it when authors do this, especially when done correctly. It shows an appreciation for previous authors, while introducing readers of all ages to different books/authors. \n Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library is a fun, fast paced novel. It makes me really wish there was a library just like this one in real life.

It's an innocent and light-hearted book about a team being locked in a library and solving fun clues to find the way out. After finishing the thriller The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and immediately starting this book, I first had a little trouble suspending disbelief that the parents were ok with the lockdown. But after I assimilated to a middle school reader's mindset, the actual storyline was a lot of fun. As I was reading through all of clues based of puzzles, riddles, and titles of books that I loved as a kid, I felt a nostalgia for my childhood books. \n This book has the fantastical quirks of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the competitive game vibe of the Hunger Games, minus the danger/violence/killing of course, but also its own unique twist by adding in classic and modern book cameos. The collaborative team members and the clues and puzzles also had a flavor of the Swindle series by Gordon Korman, which I also loved reading when I was younger. \n If I were still in this age-appropriate audience, this would be a 5 star book with all of the book cameos and the fun clues and puzzles to solve. But my standards for a complete 5-stars has changed. I still read this with surface-level entertainment with a taint of nolstagia rather than a book with deeper undercurrents in meaning or plot. Still, the book was still just so much fun to read. Chris Grabenstein truly poured in a lot of child's creativity in writing this book, and this creativity definitely shaped this fun in the book. \n 3.5""",4.13,"A New York Times Bestseller

It will particularly appeal to fans of Willy Wonka and those who like gaming and logic puzzles. \n The book is about 12-year-old Kyle, who loves playing all sorts of games--but his favorite are games created by his favorite gamemaker, Mr. Lemoncello. It just so happens that Mr. Lemoncello grew up in the same city Kyle lives in, and Mr. Lemoncello donated money to build a brand new, super high tech library for the town. Kyle is one of the winners of a contest to be the first to explore the new library in an overnight lock-in. Except Kyle and the other kids soon learn they can't just leave in the morning. They must solve Mr. Lemoncello's masterfully created puzzle in order to escape the library--and there's a pretty nice prize to be the first one to escape. \n The best part of the book is that a lot of the puzzles are included in the book (rather than just being described), so readers get to play along with Kyle and his competitors. That being said, don't listen to the audiobook version of this one, unless you're also following along in the book.

In celebration of his own birthday, based on the essays they write, he chooses twelve youngsters who are twelve years old. As their prize, they are invited to a lock-in at the new library. But because the children have never had the chance to use a public library, he concocts a game in which they must use the library\'s resources to find their way out. Readers will enjoy the personalities of all the participants, especially Kyle Keeley, who is overshadowed by his two older brothers in daily life but shines in games, and the dastardly Charles Chiltington who plans to win at all costs. As the clues start to turn up, some of the participants even form alliances. Not only is this a love letter to books, reading, and libraries in all sorts of ways, but the author has cleverly inserted throughout the book word play based on the titles of books for children. For instance, Mr. Lemoncello tells them he has great expectations of them and ""to race upstairs like the rats of NIMH!"" (p. 259). Readers will romp through the Dewey Decimal System while also gathering quite a list of recommended children\'s classics (many of them Newbery winners such as When I Reach You and From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankenweiler that most young readers will enjoy discovering--if they haven\'t already.

Elizabeth was born into an age of religious strife, in which plots and factions were everywhere and private beliefs could be punished by death. When she became queen, her counselors urged her to marry quickly and turn the responsibilities of governing over to her husband, But she outwitted them by stalling, changing her mind; and playing one side against another, as she steered her country to the glorious era of peace and security that would be called the Elizabethan Age.
Elizabeth's forceful personality, colorful court, and devoted subjects come vividly to life in this stellar picture-book biography.

This book contains four of the tales, with their prologues and introductory material. The stories are: \n * The Nun\'s Priest\'s Tale \n * The Pardoner\'s Tale \n * The Wife of Bath\'s Tale \n * The Franklin\'s Prologue \n The idea of teaching these stories at the dialectic (junior high) level intrigued me. My (admittedly limited) exposure to Chaucer had inclined me to see his admirable writing as full of mature themes. Satire, irony, and innuendo clothe a discerning criticism of society, class, faith and church. \n Cohen\'s adaptation successfully captures Chaucer, and reveals I do remember some things accurately (oh, joyful encouragement!). Beautiful period illustrations complement the text. \n However, even with the guidance of our home school curriculum, I just could not find our dialectic students ready for the material. We are in the early side of dialectic, maybe later junior high or high school? I suspect they might prefer a text with an increased number of the Tales, and these adolescent readers are sensitive about the large book format. To an adult, it says ""coffee table"", but to a teen it says ""juvenile"". Myself being of the adult persuasion, I found Cohen\'s effort a wonderful refresher in Chaucer. A palatable read to enjoy with a nice, hot drink. It\'s a lovely book that simply didn\'t work for our purposes, which is probably more the fault of the home school curriculum (who I generally adore). \n Therein lies the quandary. What is the market? The serious student of Chaucer will want more Tales, regardless of the lovely presentation, and the introductory student, likely to appreciate the period illustration, will require less of the mature themes. But if you want a gorgeous presentation of a few Tales to enjoy occasionally, or impress your literary friends, this may be the perfect version for you!'",3.75,"Lively, absorbing, often outrageously funny, Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"" is a work of genius, an undisputed classic that has held a special appeal for each generation of readers.

Maybe I simply built this story into something more than it was -- I've always loved the young girl going on a quest and rescuing the boy for once! -- but I certainly don't recall the Snow Queen just fucking off to visit some volcanoes (can't blame her though; that sounds cool) or Gerda saving Kai in part because of a Bible verse.

Readers get to see how these four boys navigate the trials that are put in front of them, and in the end each figures out that while things might not go smoothly, they're always going to be a part of the fabulous family Fletcher. \n Identify at least 2 characteristics of this genre and subgenre and discuss how they appear in your book: \n Middle grade fiction must avoid long, descriptive sections. This novel does this. It is mostly driven through the action of the four rambunctious boys, but does contain dialogue. Each chapter is short, focusing in on a scene of misadventure--the Halloween party gets rained out, the older soccer-playing brother tries out for the school play, the nerdy boy refuses to go back to school, the Thanksgiving turkey doesn't get cooked. It moves quickly, and packs a great deal of plot into a small(ish) package. \n Middle grade fiction must have relatable themes. This novel definitely has themes a middle school student can relate to. Who am I? What is my place in this family? How can I balance what I want with what I need? Why is my best friend being a jerk? Is my brother's imaginary girlfriend real? And, each question is answered for each kid in the book, maybe not in the way that the reader wants it to be, but in a way that satisfies the brother. \n In what ways and how well does the book as a whole serve its intended audience?: \n Middle school students will eat this book up. It is a fast and funny story. When kids ask for a funny book, defiantly hand them this. At the same time, it does talk about things that will be totally relatable for them. The boys are going through some serious issues in a very comedic way. And, you also see how adults deal with their issues. The neighbor is grumpy because he's lost his mother. Aunt Lucy breaks her leg, and Papa and Dad have only a loose grasp on this house-full of crazy boys. Seeing how adults deal with adversity will also be appealing to younger readers because it is set up in a way that they will be able to understand the frustration and road block of all people. \n Awards if any: \n Kirkus Reviews starred 06/01/14 \n School Library Journal starred 06/01/14 \n A Junior Library Guild Selection \n Links to published reviews from professional sources: \n Booklist July 2014 (Vol. 110, No. 21) \n Horn Book Magazine September/October, 2014 \n Library Media Connection January/February 2015 \n School Library Journal June 1, 2014""",3.99,"Meet the Fletchers.

Now I have recently read ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" which is actually Mo Willems\' first children\'s book and is a Caldecott Honor book and it is about how the Pigeon keeps asking the audience if he could drive the bus after the bus driver leaves to run an errand. ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" is truly a memorable book that children can read over and over again! \n At the beginning of the book, a bus driver comes by and tells the audience that he has to leave to do something, but before he leaves, he warns the audience, ""DON\'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS!"" After the bus driver leaves, the pigeon comes by and starts asking the audience if he could drive the bus. \n Wow! I never would have thought that a book a pigeon just asking the audience if he can drive the bus throughout the book would be so interesting to read! Mo Willems has done an awesome job at both illustrating and writing this book about the pigeon asking everyone if he could drive the bus. What I found so interesting about this book was the fact that the only illustrations shown in this book were mainly of a blue pigeon and a bus driver in a grey and green uniform who only shows up at the beginning and end of the book, but Mo Williems did a great job at making this book extremely hilarious by giving out different expressions for the pigeon which ranges from excitement to anger. Mo Williem\'s writing is extremely simple yet witty at the same time as it goes to show that you do not have to have long sentences to make a great book! What I really loved about Mo Williems\' writing is the dialogue that the Pigeon is given as it is hilarious and witty to listen to and my favorite quotes from the pigeon were, ""Pigeon at the Wheel!"" and ""No? I never get to do anything!"" \n All in all, ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" is truly one unique and hilarious children\'s book that every child who love witty humor will definitely get a kick out of it! I would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book and the format is simple enough for small children to understand. \n Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog'",4.29,"When a bus driver takes a break from his route, a very unlikely volunteer springs up to take his place-a pigeon!

However, the driver gave the reader specific instructions: ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" \n A. Area for comment: Illustration and tone \n B. Willems skillfully uses his illustrative technique along with the use of expressive dialog to convey meaning and express the tone of the text. Though the formation of the pigeon is simple, the various facial expressions and gestures, along with the specific dialog, allow the reader to see how desperate the pigeon is to drive the bus. This technique also draws the reader into the text by specifically assigning the reader ""responsibility"" of watching over the bus. \n C. Examples: Immediately from the endpapers, and title page, the reader is pulled in as part of the text. After the pigeon asks if he can drive the bus, the consecutive page shows him bending over, as if in the position of a prayer request, while saying ""Please?"" This combination of illustration and text adds to the realism of the cartoon pigeon and makes the tone of the text much more fun and engaging for the audience. Also when the pigeon requests to play ""Drive the Bus"" and then says ""I\'ll go first!"" and is drawn sprinting with his head off the page, this expresses to the reader his dire eagerness to drive the bus. Lastly, the pages in which there are several single frames with the pigeon begging and stating reasons for driving the bus such as ""I\'ll be your best friend!"" and ""How \'bout I give you five bucks?,"" each depict the pigeon in correlation to the response he is stating, which in turn makes the tone of the story much more expressive and entertaining. \n Curriculum correlation: I feel that this is a great book for young children in the preschool to kindergarten age group. I think it serves as a great example of how books can grasp the attention of the reader and include him or her within the text, which is likely to teach children the joy of reading.'",4.29,"When a bus driver takes a break from his route, a very unlikely volunteer springs up to take his place-a pigeon!

You have undoubtedly picked up this book by mistake, so please put it down. Nobody in their right mind would read this particular book about the lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire on purpose, because each dismal moment of their stay in the village of V.F.D. has been faithfully and dreadfully recorded in these pages.
I can think of no single reason why anyone would want to open a book containing such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe Cell, and some very strange hats.
It is my solemn and sacred occupation to research each detail of the Baudelaire children's lives and write them all down, but you may prefer to do some other solemn and sacred thing, such as reading another book instead.
With all due respect,
