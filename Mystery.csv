Her prose is absolutely beautiful. With that being said, she needs an editor badly; someone to reel her in when she begins to wax poetically into a never-ending stream of consciousness. The reason why Tartt gets away with ridiculously long narratives because of how well written it actually is and, in another 10 years when her next novel comes out, the masses will clamour on how it is the greatest thing since the pre sliced bagel. \n The Little Friend, just like The Secret History and The Goldfinch, started out strongly usually with a death. Nine year old Robin is found hanged on a Mother's Day afternoon. The event deeply affects the Cleve Dufrenes family for many year culminating in Robin's youngest sister, Harriet, investigating and zeroing in on the Meth making and dealing Ratcliff family. Specifically on Danny Ratcliff since he was the same age as Robin and apparently did mean things to Robin. \n Now, for people expecting this to be a mystery will be sorely disappointed. SPOILER ALERT: Robin's killer is never revealed. That I could easily get over. The crux of the story was how Robin's senseless death continues to keep his family stagnant, as it did with his mother Charlotte and sister Allison, or change them fundamentally as it did with his grandmother Edie. \n The Little Friend is a Southern Gothic family drama and if Tartt had stood with the Cleve Dufrenes clan, I might have been a tad kinder with this review. However, she felt the need to give the Ratcliff family equal share and the introduction to the world's most boring drug dealing family happened. \n Reading this novel was like having a fever induced dream. There were moments of luidity like just how much the family changed, Harriet's obsession with Danny, Harriet's isolation in camp, Libby's death but the everything else bored or confused me greatly. Can anyone tell me when this book takes place? I swear I couldn't pin it down. I hated the Ratcliffs, the Odoms, and Hely! God Hely was so annoying! I was hoping he would upset a behive, get stunned, and die My Girl style but no. \n The Little Friend was about 610 pages. I believe that I deserved a better ending than the one I got. What the hell was that? I can say confidently that I am never reading another Tartt novel.

This event has a profound effect on the family, including the young sister of the murdered boy, who, one summer in her 12th year, becomes obsessed with finding and bringing to justice her brother's murderer. Her investigation leads her in the direction of a poor local family. Soon, Harriet becomes swept up in breathtakingly amoral choices and sets in motion events that lead to their own tragic consequences. \n The Little Friend is a long book, and it drags in the middle. The broad sweep of the novel is compelling. Tartt asks us questions: about race and class, and the impact of family history on individual outcomes; on the possibility of children committing adult and dangerous acts, and how the adults around them misinterpret those events.

The narrator seems to hover omnisciently over the town, sometimes speaking (seemingly) objectively and other times dropping into characters' minds and taking on their thoughts and biases while still narrating in third person. There's some interesting technical stuff going on here which I won't pretend to fully comprehend. \n Frankly I can't think of anyone in my social circle who wouldn't hate this book, so I can't even recommend it to anyone.

As usual when reading Tartt's books, I developed a sense of concern or morbid fascination for the characters' well-being (be they angels or assholes or something in between) and wanted to know more about their fates beyond the last page of the book. \n I think this book is about Danny more than Harriet. Also... regret, loss, grief (for passages of one's life or self more than for particular people), memory, childhood, decay... did I mention loss? \n All that to say: you'll probably hate this book.

On a Mother\'s Day afternoon in the 1960\'s, nine-year old Robin was found hung from a tree near the back lot of the property. His sisters, four-year old Alison and baby Harriett in her stroller, were nearby in the back yard. The murder was never solved. No one had any clues to go on and the death of little Robin became the stuff of legend in the town. His image was even incorporated as one of the little children surrounding Jesus in a church\'s stained glass window. \n Donna Tartt\'s second novel, \'The Little Friend\', never solves the mystery of Robin\'s murder so those expecting a riveting murder yarn unfolding in a web of clues and revelations will be disappointed. What \'The Little Friend\' deals with is a paralyzed family. The parents, Charlotte and Dix, are separated. Dix took a job in Nashville, supports the family financially and usually pays an annual visit. Charlotte spends her days sedated by tranquilizers much of the time, emotionally remote and inaccessible. Alison sleeps 12-14 hours a day, depending on whether she has to be at school. Harriett is now a sassy twelve-year old, a mercurial tomboy that spends much of her time reading adventures, both fictional, as in Robert Louis Stevenson\'s \'Treasure Island\', or true-life, such as accounts of Robert Scott\'s ill-fated Antarctic expedition. With so much time on her hands, she plays with a younger boy, Hely Hull. Together they think of fanciful schemes and adventures, usually harmless. That changes after Harriett attempts to penetrate the mystery of her older brother\'s death. Her sister and her mother both avoid the subject whenever Harriett asks them about it, as do her grandmother Edie and great aunts Libby, Adelaide and Tatty. \n Hely\'s older brother, Pemberton, was a friend of Robin\'s and when Harriett asks him about what he knows he tells her about Danny Ratliff and the rest of his poor white trash clan. He says that Danny used to boast about doing a lot of horrible things (although, interestingly enough, none of them was the murder of Robin). Pemberton tells her about the rest of the clan--older demented brother Farish, who shot himself in the head and somehow survived and served time in a mental institution; Eugene, who served time in prison, became born again, now an evangelical snake handler; the youngest, a retarded boy named Curtis, the only one who has a sweet nature and means no harm to anyone. All of these details accumulate in Harriett\'s mind to convince her that Danny was the one who killed Robin. No one suspected him because he was a kid at the time. Harriett proceeds to enact a campaign of vigilante justice that spirals out of control as soon as it stops being a Harriett/Hely fantasy and transforms into destructive action. Beyond that I will not summarize. \n Harriett has the same general physical appearance as Scout in the film version of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\' although she is about six to eight years older. Scout is also much more innocent and milder in her rebellions. Like Dill, Hely is a similar little sidekick, although Hely contemplates more dangerous schemes and continually fantasizes that he\'s James Bond on his latest caper. Incidentally, Hely is not the \'little friend\' of the title. The actual little friend is not who most readers would suspect. \n The Ratliffs are slightly similar to the Ewells of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\' although they are more akin to the meth families of Elmore Leonard\'s Harlan County in the TV series \'Justified\'. Danny is also not the psycho killer that Harriett has conjured in his mind. He is a tired, wasted meth addict that just wants to get out from under the insane tyranny of his brother Farish. \n Donna Tartt obviously knows this region as it is a fictional counterpart to where she grew up. Harriett is roughly the same age as Donna, born in the sixties with most of her childhood and adolescence in the seventies when the action of this novel occurs. Almost any novel set in Mississippi must at some point be compared to the work of William Faulkner so here are my Faulkner observations: the Ratliffs resemble the Snopes although they\'re not as populous. Also, there is no Ratliff that has the steely determination to outwit and con his \'betters\' on the social scale, as Flem did in \'The Hamlet\' and its two sequels. Harriett\'s grandmother, Edie, and her sisters are all the daughters of the notable Judge Cleve, remnants of old Southern aristocracy similar to the Sartoris and Compson families. The family plantation, named \'Tribulation\', eventually fell into disrepair and the family fell on hard times. By the seventies, there is just an empty lot where Tribulation once stood. While all of the sisters still consider themselves in some way aging Southern belles, Edie in particular has a no-nonsense, cut to the chase manner. A former nurse, she never flinches at the sight of blood and can be counted on to not lose her cool in frightening situations. The following quote is characteristic of how she assesses social scale and race: \n ""A poor Negro has at least the excuse of his birth,"" Edie said. ""The poor white has nothing to blame for his station but his own character. Well, of course, that won\'t do. That would mean having to assume some responsibility for his own laziness and sorry behavior. No, he\'d much rather stomp around burning crosses and blaming the Negro for everything than go out and try to get an education or improve himself in any way."" \n Harriett is much like her grandmother in many ways. She has the same toughness although she is less able to conform to social expectations. She would rather suffer the boredom of a summer of humid afternoons reading or wandering than endure the hell of a summer church camp, which she has endured in the past. She also deals with her failure by justifying it as a worthy cause: \n ""Even if it meant that she had failed, she was glad. And if what she\'d wanted had been impossible from the start, still there was a certain lonely comfort in the fact that she\'d known it was impossible and had gone ahead and done it anyway."" \n Harriett has gotten an early start on teenage rebellion and distrust of authority. She is also emotionally detached from her addled, erratic mother, even when her mother explodes in a rage at her and then immediately apologizes, pulling Harriett to her breast in a vise-like hug: \n ""Up above, as if from a distance, her mother wept and coughed with muffled hacking sounds, like a shipwreck victim washed up on a beach. The pink fabric of the nightgown, pressed against Harriett\'s cheek, was so magnified that it didn\'t even look like cloth, but a technical cross-hatch of coarse, ropy skeins. It was interesting. Harriett shut the eye against her mother\'s breast. The pink vanished. Both eyes open: back it popped. She experimented with alternate winks, watching the optical illusions leap back and forth until a fat tear--inordinately huge--dropped onto the cloth and spread in a crimson stain."" \n Donna Tartt is very gifted at capturing perceptual moments such as this. She captures the flavor of humid, languid, boring summer days as well as the nighttime isolation of being at variance with the rest of the sleeping world as Harriett often gets up late at night to wander the house while her mother and sister lie oblivious in their slumbers. \n Tartt takes her time in letting the story unfold, alternating points of view between Harriett, her sister, her grandmother, Hely and the Ratliffs, often in passages that wear out their welcome with a bit too much extraneous detail. Despite the leisurely pace, I feel that the ending is a bit rushed and ends on a note of triviality, neutering the dramatic impact of the climax. Although she has already written over 600 pages, I felt like there needed to be a few more loose ends tied up, not necessarily as far as the plot, but with the primary protagonist--Harriett. Instead, the novel ends with a scene in which she is not even present. \n However, those shortcomings do not negate the power of Tartt\'s primary accomplishment which is the depiction of the unreliability of memory. Harriett\'s realization is that she can never prove or disprove an event that occurred before she was cognizant; neither can she ever live with complete certainty of the consequences of her own actions. Although Faulkner famously stated, ""The past is never dead. It\'s not even past,"" I think Donna Tartt could add, at least on the basis of \'The Little Friend\', nor is it ever any more completely knowable than the present.'",3.44,"Bestselling author Donna Tartt returns with a grandly ambitious and utterly riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil.

The death of her older brother 11 years previously casts a shadow over her whole family and life. Her parents are essentially separated, and she lives with her mother and sister and African-American housekeeper, in a household swathed in grief. She receives more care from her grandmother and maiden aunts than her own parents give her. \n She and her friend Hely decide to track down her older brother\'s murderer (the case was never solved) and they begin to stalk a family of low-life brothers, ""country folk."" \n Overall, this is a deeply sad story, with race and class implications. Anytime I read about a child who grows up lacking love and attention, it makes me sad. \n Tartt does an excellent job of setting the scene and describing the many characters in depth. Many readers believe that this novel moves too slowly, but I thought it was a very interesting read. \n I have two quibbles with this book. One is that a character, presumed to be dead, is not dead...and the circumstances are way too far-fetched. Second, I found the ending to be highly unsatisfying. I prefer books with more conclusion to them--I think that\'s another reason why other readers have been unhappy with this book. \n So if you like plots to be wrapped around in a nice package at the end, you should probably avoid this book. But if you enjoy excellent story telling and command of language, and don\'t mind a slow-moving plot, you should give it a try.'",3.44,"Bestselling author Donna Tartt returns with a grandly ambitious and utterly riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil.

Such a man was Philip Marlowe, private eye, an educated, heroic, streetwise, rugged individualist and the hero of Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep. This work established Chandler as the master of the 'hard-boiled' detective novel, and his articulate and literary style of writing won him a large audience, which ranged from the man in the street to the most sophisticated intellectual.

She\'s more focused on her budding romance with the school outcast, Ollie, until a second murder strikes fear into everyone in town. Maybe Makani lying so she can spend more time with Ollie is putting her in even greater jeopardy, since she might be next on the killer\'s list. She hasn\'t told anyone the reason she moved from Hawaii to Nebraska, and the killer seems focused on offing students who stand out in some way. \n I know 3 stars seems like a low rating - I think I might have had my expectations too high for this book. At the Boston Teen Author Festival a couple of weeks ago, one of the authors was talking about subverting tropes and how this novel didn\'t, it was just a perfectly executed thriller. So I knew going in that there wasn\'t going to be a twist at the end, that it was a straight teen slasher novel. There are definitely some wonderfully creepy moments, which scarily resemble one of my worst nightmares, wherein the victims discover common objects in their homes moved around. It\'s definitely a great thriller, and the pace kept me turning pages. \n In relation to the trope conversation above, I think there are a lot of young readers who have never read a straight thriller, and so for them this is new, but for me this is simply a better-written version of the R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike novels I devoured as a teen. Honestly I kept waiting for a twist, especially after they figured out the identity of the killer about 60% of the way through the book. The hot pink of the cover text and book design led me to believe the killer had to be Ollie, who has pink dyed hair . For some reason, the movie ""Scream"" kept coming into my head, and I figured there would be two killers. I also expected, from the title, that the grand finale would happen inside Makani\'s house. It happened in a haunted corn maze, which was fantastic, but again I just expected something different . I also expected, after Makani reveals the reason she left Hawaii, for that to somehow come into play. The killer\'s reasoning felt a little weak and I wanted it all to be more connected somehow, more so than it was. \n So, I am giving this three stars because it was enjoyable to read and well-written, but didn\'t do anything new for the genre.'",3.44,"Love hurts...

Zoe Maisey is a seventeen-year-old musical prodigy with a genius IQ. Three years ago, she was involved in a tragic incident that left three classmates dead. She served her time, and now her mother, Maria, is resolved to keep that devastating fact tucked far away from their new beginning, hiding the past even from her new husband and demanding Zoe do the same.
Tonight Zoe is giving a recital that Maria has been planning for months. It needs to be the performance of her life. But instead, by the end of the evening, Maria is dead.
In the aftermath, everyone--police, family, Zoe's former solicitor, and Zoe herself--tries to piece together what happened. But as Zoe knows all too well, the truth is rarely straightforward, and the closer we are to someone, the less we may see.
Unfolding over a span of twenty-four hours through three compelling narratives, The Perfect Girl is gripping, surprising, and emotionally complex--a richly layered look at loyalty, second chances, and the way secrets unravel us all.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28959413-the-perfect-girl,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468230907m/28959413.jpg,48003255,The Perfect Girl,Mystery,star,0.0

Here are my thoughts: \n ^^ This is the story of a couple, Anne and Marco Conti, who plan to go next door for a party around their neighbour's house, but after the childminder lets them down last minute, they convince themselves not to cancel but to go anyway, with the idea that it will be all right to leave their baby at home and check on her every half hour. After all, they have a baby monitor with them, too. What could possibly go wrong? It's only next door. \n ^^ When the baby goes missing we delve further into each characters lives to discover what really went on. But it's just not that simple, as with most stories like this, there are often unreliable witnesses and hidden story depths that make it less easy for the reader to work out the truth straight away. This is what happens in this book , and even though I had my suspicions instantly about who done it, the why and the how was not revealed until the very end. \n ^^ The Couple Next Door is told in different point of views and with a limited omniscient point of view where the author Shari Lapena limits the readers to being in one character's head at a time. We hear their thoughts, see their actions, we understand what they are not saying to the other characters and know if they are lying to themselves. Writing this way is very clever and gaining popularity again. \n ^^ This story throws out all sorts of questions. What would you have done? Who really is in the wrong here? Is being weak a crime? It also shows you how life can change dramatically in a blink of an eye from one single bad decision. It's the sort of story most people say 'chances of that happening in real life are extremely rare', but you only have to look at the news, on your computer, phone or newspapers to see the truth... People are people and some are capable of doing some very strange things. \n Overall: \n I've been lucky and read two books within one week that were equally enthralling, suspenseful and fast paced, so much so I didn't want to put either books down until finished. With this one, Shari Lapena 's The Couple Nextdoor, I find it slightly beats the other as the story still lingered in the back of my mind long after I'd finished reading; the clever plot twists, the the red herrings, and other tension strengthening distractions, and the marvellous, most satisfying way it all came together at the end, but with more shocks to boot. I can happily recommend this as a well crafted story that truly made me think about what people really are capable of when pushed to their absolute limit. And I mean this from both the antagonist and the protagonist's point of view.""",3.74,"You never know what's happening on the other side of the wall.

I could maybe have also pretended that all characters weren't either stereotypes wrapped in cliches or just plain cardboards. \n However...it is not well written. It's juvenile at best. It reads like a high-schooler trying to reach the word count by repeating the same sentence here and there over and over, hoping the teacher won't notice. That if they pretend it's just to remind the reader of some key point (that I could have come to myself, thank you very much AND that has been said at least 3 or 4 times before!) it wouldn't sound like just plain repetition, on top of telling not showing. \n All in all I wouldn't recommend this novel unless you want to know the mystery because it's been talked.

It sounded good and one of my fave booktubers recommended it. \n But I was really let down by this novel. \n Anne and Marco Conti just had their first baby. Anne suffers from postpartum depression. Marco wonders where his wife has gone. The couple next door offer a night to get away from their problems. But the babysitter cancels and Anne and Marco just decide to leave their baby at home unattended. And by the time they get home, the baby is missing. \n Of course, this dredges up all of the horrible secrets that the couple have been keeping from each other. It brings in the in-laws who hate Marco and have spoiled Anne. And drama ensues. \n Why didn't I like this novel? One of the major things that bothered me within the first hundred pages was the writing style. The writing is told entirely in the third person and it is just very stilted. There was no emotion. \n And I wanted to make a drinking game for every time the author mentions that the detective will figure out the truth behind it all (really? that seemed necessary to repeat a billion times?). \n The plot line is very slow. In fact, at least half of the novel is just the parents agonizing over what they've kept from each other. Very little actually happens. \n And I didn't find the resolution of this novel to be satisfying-at all. ****SPOILERS First off, how did Marco get hit in the head by the kidnapper if the kidnapper is the father-in-law? Since the father-in-law was at the house and nowhere near the rendezvous point? And the accomplice was already dead? And what was that business about the next door neighbors being in some sort of illegal sex-tape thing? And then that the neighbor was sleeping with the father-in-law? And about Anne's blackouts and she goes nuts on the neighbor? SPOILERS**** I felt like so many things were just not wrapped up properly.

Eva is walking by the river one afternoon when a body floats to the surface of the icy water. She tells her daughter to wait patiently while she calls the police, but when she reaches the phone box, Eva dials another number altogether. The dead man, Egil, has been missing for months, and it doesn't take long for Inspector Sejer and his team to establish that he was the victim of a very violent killer, but the trail has gone cold. It's as puzzling as another unsolved case on Sejer's desk: the murder of a prostitute who was found dead just before Egil went missing.
While Sejer is trying to piece together the fragments of a seemingly impossible case, Eva gets a phone call late one night. A stranger speaks, then swiftly hangs up. Eva looks out into the darkness and listens. All is quiet. Gripping and thought-provoking, this is Karin Fossum's first novel featuring the iconic Inspector Sejer.

(Alex had been wanted by the FBI due to fabricated charges and double-agent shenanigans. Hunter was shot in the kerfuffle, and is still recuperating.) They met when Alex was working at a busy, urban hospital emergency room together. Hunter is a Physician's Assistant, though he hasn't worked in six months due to recovery from his injury. Alex had his graduate school dreams derailed by the FBI manhunt and has since found a new purpose: joining the FBI to help root out bad agents, if he gets accepted. \n In the meantime, they accept a trip to the isolated Caribbean isle of Saba to spend time with old friends of Alex's mothers. Reunited with a childhood friend, Orfeo, Alex's budding Feeb senses begin to tingle--particularly when Orfeo's partner Max and his sister Talisha seem to get freaked out by Alex's desire to join the FBI. Hunter can't help noticing how agitated they become, too, so it's not only Alex getting worried about his friend's welfare. This is not an exaggeration; the island's first murder in a decade occurs a few days later, and the subject was a PI staying at Orfeo's hotel. Despite their worries, Alex and Hunter make a lot of headway into their own sexytimes--and Hunter considers making some serious declarations...of the marital type. If he can muster the nerve, that is. \n As a hurricane bears down on Saba the whole mystery becomes infinitely more deadly. And not just because of the weather. Max and Talisha have Really Bad Guys on their tail who are probably only the tip of the gargantuan iceberg of their problems. Expect a lot of hiding, scrabbling for incriminating details, and sexytimes. Oh, also, a hurricane, two desperate chases, dangerous criminals, and collaboration with known felons to hopefully make it out alive. It's an intriguing romantic suspense, and I'm sure we'll see more of Hunter and Alex in another book, likely set in Quantico, VA!""",4.12,"When Hunter and Alex (formally Shawn) are given the vacation of a lifetime, it's a chance for them to pay attention to romance and get out of the path of danger. The tiny Caribbean island of Saba is gorgeous, the first to have marriage equality, and the Sabans are the nicest people on earth.
There's lots of rum poolside for relaxing and a room with a mirror on the ceiling for passion. Hot karaoke nights, cold beer, and new friends.
Their new friends Orfeo and Max, and Max's sister Talisha, share a troubling secret. Alex and Hunter want to help. As a hurricane bears down on them, a dead body surfaces, and a purple backpack loaded with stolen jewels leads a pair of dangerous men to the island.
Alex would rather poke his own eyes out with a pointy stick than call on his old enemy Nick Truman for help; he'd also do anything to keep Hunter out of danger. But even his nemesis can't reach them now.

This review may have some LIMITED spoilers, only in the discussion of one character\'s inexplicably odd/incriminating behavior. \n Two foundling twin girls have an imaginary triplet upon whom they blame all their troubles. They have a rather charmed life, adopted by a wealthy bachelor and cared for by a dedicated cook/nanny. As teens, Alexa (Lexi) and Ava have given a whole new dimension to ""Alicia."" \n Ava likes to have an alternate identity, ""Alicia"", so she can date guys who are socially ""unsuitable"" but fun for a few dates. She leaves them wanting, but occasionally has a time conflict with her dates, so she enlists Lexi to help cover. As they are so close in appearance, the guys are none the wiser. Lexi is the bookish girl, wholly different from the sexier Ava. She does enjoy being Alicia, because this persona is confident and risky. Lexi would never date a rocker, but Alicia? She relishes Eli\'s soulfulness. \n Thing is, something has gone horribly wrong. Casey was a grabby-date-rapey-y guy, who Lexi barely escaped from; the next night he was killed. The police are looking for Alicia in connection. But, Alicia doesn\'t exist. Does she? A speeding ticket for a vehicle Alicia shows up at their home. \n Then another boy ""Alicia"" dated ends up dead. Now Lexi is determined to figure out who is setting her up, even if it\'s...Ava. \n I liked this, but I had some issues with the absolutely dumb things that Lexi does: like posing as Alicia to talk to the police, without telling anyone, just to ""find out"" what the cops knew. That\'s like Dumb X 1000. Or, when she\'s been ARRESTED and out on recognizance then learns there\'s a new target, she poses, again, as Alicia to ""warn him"". As if this won\'t be a problem. \n The book is interesting, and I liked all the twists. I didn\'t guess the true killer until the bigger reveal, so, excellent job with all the red herrings. #Props \n My biggest issue was with Lexi\'s almost willful ignorance of the danger in which she operated--she\'s a suspect in not one, but TWO murders. Even Ava, who is as SoCal superficial as they come, had the good sense to KEEP HER TRAP SHUT under questioning, leading me to wonder why Ava didn\'t apply for Stanford, instead of the ""bookish"" Lexi. Lexi seemed criminally naive, in that sense. I wonder if teens will see this my way. My own teen son branded Lexi TSTL, and I was *nearly* inclined to agree.'",3.8,"Identical twins. Identical DNA.

She's almost 18 and never gone to school. She is homeschooled by her mother, Shaylene, and spends 6 of 7 days a week in their apartment in Scottsdale, AZ. Every Friday they leave the apartment together, so Shelby can hit balls at the local batting cage, then they have ice cream for dinner and Shelby goes to the library, unescorted, for a few hours while her mother works. This library time is the only time Shelby is ever left alone outside their apartment. \n She has never has a friend, and has no siblings. Her father is dead, and he was horrible, or so she has been told. Then, one Friday, while waiting to get picked up outside the library, Shelby is struck by a car. In her pain she meets, well, a coyote, who advises her that she will learn two lies and one truth about her life. \n For a moment I wondered if Shelby had hit the peyote, but she hadn't. She did have a broken ankle, however, and in the aftermath of her care finds herself and her mother on the road. Escaping, her mother tells her, from her (dead) father. Because if he finds them, they're as good as dead. Yep. Guess Shelby's dad isn't so dead after all. \n Or, is he? How can Shelby trust her mom--as she watches her befriend unsuspecting men with the objective of stealing their vehicles. And, the coyote continues to return. \n When Shelby sleeps she falls into the Dreaming, a place of myth and mystery where she is the Maiden and must rescue the crying Child from a malevolent force in order to restore the rain and keep the Dreaming alive. In this mythical place Shelby is aided by the trickster Coyote, as well as the stalwart Elk and strong Eagle. It is here she is told she has 8 days to save the Child or the Dreaming--and Shelby's whole universe--will be destroyed. \n This is a strongly metaphysical book, with real and mythical touch points. In her waking life, Shelby learns that there are very big portions of her life that are lies, and the truth that is revealed is just as devastating. There are car chases, and police actions and people who try to help and end up only causing more harm. \n I adored the elements of First Nations mysticism and mythology that were interwoven. This book sang with cultural tenets, and a realistic depiction of a displaced teen. Shelby, herself, is at a major disadvantage as her own advocate--not because she is young (she's almost an adult) but because people assume she is disabled. She has some difficulties, but that doesn't diminish her capability. Throughout Shelby is self-possessed and as independent as she is ever allowed to be. \n I am not ashamed to admit there were twists I didn't see coming. I did, however, predict the bulk of the ending--as the foreshadowing was excellent. The ticking time bomb of Shelby's world is a strong motivator, but she can't often access the tools, or skills, she needs to complete her quest in the Dreaming, and must return to reality to marshal resources. In the end, the heartache that is Shelby's life is greatly resolved, on her terms for a change. No more isolation. Actual friendships and autonomy, and a family she never expected. \n I received and ARC of this book via NetGalley.""",3.42,"In four hours, Shelby Jane Cooper will be struck by a car.

It takes place in the early 1970s, in Mississippi's Ford County, and revolves around the brutal murder and rape of a woman in the presence of her two young children. The suspect, pretty much assumed guilty before the trial even starts, is one Danny Padgitt, a young man who lives with his large family on the Padgitt Island just outside the town of Clanton. Danny's trial moves forward, he's found guilty, and sentenced to two terms in prison, each of them ten years in length. \n All of this is chronicled by the county's newspaper managed by new owner and editor Willy Traynor. Willy is a young fellow who has recently arrived in Clanton from Memphis, eager to exercise his journalism skills. Danny's trial and conviction is just the medicine Willy needs to increase circulation and make some money as well. \n Grisham shifts gears in the second half by showing the effect of school desegregation in the American south along with Willy's friendship with a elderly black woman named Callie. She was a juror on Danny Padgitt's trial but more remarkable is her having seven adult children, six of whom are teachers with PhDs. \n In the late 1970s, in a surprising move, Danny comes up for parole. It turns out that his ten year sentences were to run concurrently instead of sequentially, a fact that was not at all well known by Clanton residents. Danny is granted parole and that's when the trouble starts up again. Someone is murdered, a not unusual event in Ford County, but when a second murder occurs shortly after, the police take greater notice. It turns out that both victims had been jury members for Danny's trial and now the entire populace is on edge. Who will be next? \n The book's plot loses some momentum at the second half's start but the detail concerning the characters and their life styles in that part of America are interesting. As for the ending, get ready for a big surprise.""",3.86,"In 1970, one of Mississippi s more colorful weekly newspapers, TheFord County Times,went bankrupt.

It's an amazing debut novel - the characters are well fledged, the plot is engaging and the ending leaves you wishing you wanting more more mysteries by Patricia Gibney. I found this book by chance my Goodreads and I am very glad I did. \n The protagonist, Detective Inspector Lottie Parker, is one of those characters you can easily relate to. She's a single working mother dealing with three teenagers, which is not easy and apart from her domestic life, she has to juggle her career as a Detective Inspector. Rather than providing a perfect super-mom, we experience DI Parker's struggles with keeping up with her career and her family, her deeply rooted grief over the loss of her husband and her insecurity and doubts of her capability of taking care of her children. \n Overall Lottie Parker is a very interesting protagonist and I am looking forward to read more mystery novels portrayed from her eyes. I also did enjoy the other supporting characters in the book, especially Boyd, who will definitely be a fan favourite for being the one who hooks up with Lottie. I have to admit, there is a certain level of charm with Kirby's personality as well. I also did warm up to the grumpy boss and her kids. The author did manage to create a well-rounded team and family, which is very reminiscent of some of the most successful TV mystery series. \n The plot shifts between two timelines; the past, in the 70's, and the present. I did enjoy the fact that the author did manage to tie off a lot of loose ends and mysteries that rose from the 70's plot-line and the mysteries that arose from the murders in the present. It is possible that it is the reason why the book is relatively long, but the short chapters did really help the readers in breezing through this book. Who am I kidding, I was so curious to uncover the secrets that I would have probably breezed through this book in any way! But it definitely did help with the flow of this book, since it's much easier to stop at the end of a chapter and restart with a fresh chapter later on. \n This book does cover some possibly controversial and disturbing matters, such as child abuse and exploitation, which does feel heavy at times. \n In any way, I really did enjoy this book and would give it a solid five stars. I have already ordered the second book, The Stolen Girls, and look forward to receiving it.""",4.12,"The hole they dug was not deep. A white flour bag encased the little body.

Detective Lottie Parker is a bit of a wild card, often breaking the rules slightly to get the outcome she wants, and her partner Mark Boyd who I really warmed to as well! They're both flawed in their own ways - neither of them are perfect - but this only makes them more likable, in my opinion! Lottie is certainly not the perfect mother but her heart is in the right place and she has her own demons to struggle with. The personal lives of the officers added an extra element to the story, on top of the already gripping investigative storyline. \n The theme of corruption in 1970's Ireland, particularly in the Catholic Church, is a well-known one and I found it really interesting (if not quite uncomfortable) to read about. It felt well-researched and full of interesting details. \n The Missing Ones moves along quickly, with no time for me to get bored or disinterested. There's elements of humour, very dark parts and others which are entertaining. The case gets very personal for Lottie and some parts felt a little unbelievable, but I feel that readers always suspend their disbelief with novels like this, and I truly enjoyed every page- a fantastic new series which I'll definitely be reading more of! \n [Rating: 4.5/5] \n Many thanks to Bookouture and Netgalley for a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review.""",4.12,"The hole they dug was not deep.

The writing is taut and effective, and I haven\'t had this much fun being scared in a long time!!

Toward the last quarter, I found the action to be a bit over the top, and would have found the story scarier if Cutter had reined it in a bit. The very end I felt meh about, and kind of rewrote in my brain to better serve my purposes. I hate to poopoo a book I so thoroughly enjoyed, but I did consider the end a bit weak.

From New York Timesbestselling author Kate White comes a riveting psychological suspense in which a media star must battle a malevolent enemy who may be disturbingly close to her.
After losing her on-air job two years ago, television host Robin Trainer has fought her way back and now she's hotter than ever. With her new show climbing in the ratings and her first book a bestseller, she's being dubbed a media double threat.
But suddenly, things begin to go wrong. Small incidents at first: a nasty note left in her purse; her photo shredded. But the obnoxious quickly becomes threatening when the foundation the makeup artist uses burns Robin's face. It wasn't an accident--someone had deliberately doctored with the product.
An adversary with a dark agenda wants to hurt Robin, and the clues point to someone she works with every day.

From New York Timesbestselling author Kate White comes a riveting psychological suspense in which a media star must battle a malevolent enemy who may be disturbingly close to her.
After losing her on-air job two years ago, television host Robin Trainer has fought her way back and now she's hotter than ever. With her new show climbing in the ratings and her first book a bestseller, she's being dubbed a media double threat.
But suddenly, things begin to go wrong. Small incidents at first: a nasty note left in her purse; her photo shredded. But the obnoxious quickly becomes threatening when the foundation the makeup artist uses burns Robin's face. It wasn't an accident--someone had deliberately doctored with the product.

I haven\'t read anything else because I felt like, unless I could find it at the library and I had nothing else in my pile or I found a great deal, I\'d let them go. But then this was available on tour and the premise seemed really interesting and I thought, I haven\'t had a good thriller lately, I\'m going to give it a try. \n And.... I was disappointed. I had a hard time getting into it because I didn\'t like the main character, Robin so much. Secondly, this read a lot like Nora Roberts Private Scandals, which I read years ago and totally loved. Though that one obviously has a romance element to it and this one doesn\'t really, there were a lot of similarities for me. \n When you read the book it does feel like an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, so in that regard I enjoyed it. But the writing felt a little flat for me and I was able to figure out who the culprit was by mid book and that always ruins the second half for me. When I read a thriller, I want to be on the edge of me seat and have the gasp with ""WHAT?!"" when the bad guy is revealed. I never want to see it coming and I want to have the wind taken out of me. You\'ll get none of that with this book. \n Overall I felt like this novel could have gone a lot further and it just didn\'t. I always set out thinking I\'m going to be a big fan and I want to be. I don\'t know why, but I want to be. And then... I don\'t know. Maybe if I hadn\'t read the Nora Roberts book, or a few others similar to it, I wouldn\'t feel so blah about this one. It\'s like re-reading the same story with slightly different details and it\'s just hard for me to say- go buy this book. \n BUT- if you haven\'t read Kate White yet, this might be a good one to start with and then read The Sixes and then read Hush because it\'ll feel like she\'s getting better and better with her writing. All would make entertaining vacation reads for sure, especially if you are looking to step out of your regular genre.'",3.13,"A Los Angeles Times""Best of Summer"" Read

When I first began reading these novels, I did so in the hope that Harry would find some happiness, somewhere, with someone special. Alas, that has not happened as of The Burning Room, number 1 in the series. Harry is an admirable protagonist, moral, compassionate, and willing to take the hard line when it's called for. He deserves better than he's gotten so far. \n The Burning Room focuses upon two cold cases, one ten years old involving the shooting of a musician who has only now died of his wounds. The second involves Harry's new partner, Lucy Soto, who is young but has already begun to make her mark in the police force. When Lucy was a child, she was present when her day care center was torched, resulting in the death of several of her teachers and classmates. In fact, Lucy became a cop because of her desire to find out who committed that arson. \n Sometimes the Bosch novels are action-laden, and sometimes they're more internal. The Burning Room is one of the latter. As a result, it's more of a police procedural than anything else, so don't look for suspense and drama here. As always, politics in the department and in LA play a major role. But watching Harry as he mentors Lucy, in whom he sees himself as a young detective, and as he ponders the whole of his career, is rewarding in itself. This novel ends in a mild sort of cliff hanger, though if you look at chronology of the series, it's pretty clear what happens next. \n On to the next installment, The Crossing.""",4.05,"Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

So far back, that I can't even remember all the homicide cases that he has solved. Harry Bosch is the epitome of a tough as nails homicide detective, one that almost always gets his man. I thought I had read them all, but I think I missed The Black Box, and I really need to get on that! \n As a rule, I usually like my homicide detectives to be women, I guess because I can relate to them better. Women in jeopardy, and all that. From the minute I started reading these books, it didn't matter one bit that the main character was a man. Harry is smart, and he doesn't take anything from anyone. He knows he is a good cop, and if he has to skirt the edges of impropriety, he will, if it gets the job done. He's been through several partners-some have even died-and he has been through the wringer with all the politics of the LAPD. \n This time around, he has one year left until retirement. He has been assigned a new partner, one that is new to the job. It's up to Bosch to mentor her, and teach her the job before he leaves. Lucy was a hotshot(literally) policewoman, who was involved in a shooting, one that awarded her the Medal of Valor from the police department. This jump started her career to detective. She chooses to work in the cold case department. She has her own reasons to pick that department, due to a sad past involving a cold case that she was involved in as a child. \n So not only do they investigate the case from her childhood, but they also investigate the case of a mariachi band member that was shot in broad daylight ten years before. It took the victim ten years, but now that he has died, it's a homicide. \n It's always fascinating to see everything Bosch goes through to solve a case. Working on two cases at the same time is not an obstacle for him. Lucy, holds her own beautifully as well. As usual, these cases get them involved in politics, both police and governmental. \n I did have one problem with this book. At times, it almost read as a police procedural manual, which is fine if you want to know all those things. I think a lot of it could have been left out, and it would have made for a much more enjoyable read. It took me about a fourth of the way in before I really got involved in the story, and I think it was due to this. This was unusual for me, and a Harry Bosch book. That being said, it ended up being a good installment of these books, and very much worth the read for all mystery fans out there. I will definitely be getting the next book when it comes out!(PureTextuality.com)""",4.05,"Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

This crime novel features Detective Harry Bosch, one of the authors long standing protagonists. It kept my interest ok but was not a nail biter. It was missing a lot of the intensity of previous Bosch novels. Maybe because Bosch himself is nearing retirement, but the plot line in this one was not something that will stick with a reader long after one closes the book. \n One gripe I had was with some of the Spanish used in the novel not being correct. An example is the name of a restaurant in L.A. which he calls Poquito Pedro\'s. He states it means ""Little Pedro\'s."" The word ""poquito"" is usually used to describe a small amount of something, not used with a persons name. Another time he states the city of Adelanto means ""going forward"" but the word for that is actually ""adelante"" with an ""e"" at the end. I realize these are nit-picking gripes but one would think that in LA it would be easy to get an accurate translation. I\'m a bilingual LA native and am sure there are a few of us around with journalism backgrounds. I did chuckle a little when he used my last name as the surname of one of his characters. It isn\'t a commonly used surname in any novels I\'ve ever read, that was a surprise, but at least he spelled it correctly, lol :) \n One thing I did enjoy was the historical incidents he referred to about the City of Angels that were accurate.'",4.05,"Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

Something strange is happening up the mountain and Viktor, Navy SEAL, is going to find out exactly what it is and why his nephew ended up in a coma in hospital. His family is at risk and he will do everything and anything to protect them. \n It is a romance, a story of second and third chances. Viktor and Aiden (who is now working in law enforcement) knew each other in high school, where Aiden had long term expectations. Years later when they reconnect, he still loves Viktor. But Viktor is a man haunted by his belief that as a SEAL he can't offer anything to anyone. He runs. It takes the threat to his family to bring Viktor and Aiden together again as they put their lives at risk to solve the mystery. \n This is a story with lots of drama and action- murder, villains and true hero moments- but also soul searching as Aiden and Viktor fight their attraction to each other. The sex is super hot and the ending fabulous- i just love big moments that make people face the truth! \n I enjoyed the blend of mystery and romance and the pacing of the book. Sure, at moments Viktor annoyed the hell out of me but the happy ending for these heroes was definitely worth it. \n I am now very much looking forward to the second book, Last Marine Standing, due to be released in June, which gives us Sam's story. \n A copy of this book was received from the author with no expectations of a review. \n For m/m romance reviews and more check out Because Two Men Are Better Than One!""",3.77,"When SEAL, Viktor Zavodny, left small town America for the Navy he made sure he never had a reason to return for anything other than visiting family.

It had two great MC's and a plot that kept me glued to my kindle app. And while I loved both Viktor and Aiden, I understand why people didn't like him as much, or at all. He wasn't the easiest guy in the world to like. \n There was sexual tension in this book and it was so hot. Possibly the hottest thing in this book, which wasn't a bad thing actually. Also, I have come to the conclusion that I really like when MC's separate for silly reasons and come back together in some way. Most of the time I'm able to understand the reasons, like in this. I think it could be the reason I was able to like Viktor as much as I did. \n I thought the MC's were so perfect for each other, even if Viktor didn't want to believe it and Aiden tried to deny it because he was angry (totally understandable, btw). And I liked not knowing how they would get back together, or get together I should probably say since they were never a proper couple. Anyway, I thought the chemistry was definitely there and I enjoyed reading it. \n I also think people who like a mystery will enjoy this. There is enough of that here to satisfy fans of mystery. Honestly, I really enjoyed that part of it too. It just kept me hooked and I didn't want this book to finish when it did.

Find a quiet place, get a glass of wine or fresh brewed coffee or tea, and let the Victorian atmosphere and careful narration take you away to another time and share with you the sounds and scents that will overtake you in this beautifully written tale. \n Lady Kiera Darby, our protagonist, is a strong woman, so likeable, so smart, and so very much her own person. While there are several themes at play, Ms. Huber's neatly constructed plot never wavers from its linear progression. The central mystery is cushioned in family betrayal, PTSD issues, and the treatment of the mentally ill. \n There are moments of descriptive brilliance here, and the gentle touches to surrounding characters enhance your visit to Lady Darby's world. In one scene, Lady Darby and Gage enter a crude stone building occupied by Mrs. McCray. When she brings out her finest tea china, that simple act provides insight into this peripheral villager. And in another, Lady Darby erupts into a defensive tirade and shocks the guests in the room. As each react to the outburst, we get a clearer view behind the proper facades. \n This story has an added romantic element that is necessary to the growth of Lady Darby but does not overshadow the core that is the mystery. I enjoyed the slow build of the relationship between Lady Darby and Gage. He does confuse me a bit. But he also confuses Lady Darby. Will we learn more about his motives in book three? \n By the end of the tale, Lady Darby has certainly evolved and several of those bricks in her emotional wall have crumbled. \n I truly enjoyed every page, every sentence. I'm already in line for book three as this author delivers a carefully constructed, comfortably enveloping story with brutal lies to uncover and shocking secrets to reveal. \n But don't get too caught up in soft brocade, feathery breezes or the breathtaking Scottish landscape.

The presentation of the London theater scene during the between wars era is appealing. And the collective and personnal feelings of loss and confusion following the events of the Great War were compellingly told. \n I\'m not sure what, other than publicity value, led the author to use Josephine Tey as the name of the central character, rather than her real-life name Elizabeth Mackintosh.

She has quite a few psychological problems, but when it comes to the crunch she takes charge and doesn't vacillate about what needs to be done. \n Several aspects of the story left me a bit confused and a little annoyed e.g. Lei and her dog were in pursuit of a suspect but a civilian got in the way and the chase ended, but because the women was scared by her dog, not injured, Lei was prosecuted by the police, fined twice, reprimanded and forced to undergo a series of psychological examinations. I really didn't understand this. \n As whole this isn't a bad story and I would have happily given it 3.5 stars but I did find the number of stupid mistakes she made and the strained love life annoying, so I settled for 3.""",3.82,"Hawaii is palm trees, black sand and blue water--but for policewoman Lei Texeira, there's a dark side to paradise.

It mixes in the elements you will see from your typical slasher movie, but also adds a paranormal, demonic possession storyline ala Exorcist. If I was being nitpicky, I'd say it was less Scream like though, as Scream was a movie that tossed the slasher conventions on their head, and created clever twists using those tropes. This book does play it more standard, and is therefore more generic than clever in the end. Despite this however, I did enjoy this. \n The plot line for 'The Harrowing' follows five teenagers, all from different social groups, who have decided to stay within the confines of their university during a holiday period instead of going home. While alone on campus, they make the clever horror movie decision to play with a ouija board, and chaos ensues.... \n What I most appreciated about this book was that it actually put some though into the demonic possession angle. While the entity is of course evil, it's not simply just the devil, or a dead person with 'unfinished business'. The twists and turns kept me intrigued to the finale, and while ultimately the whole thing is a little predictable, I can at least say I was entertained throughout. \n The characters here are pretty generic, each one belonging to your typical horror movie archetypes. We have the geek, the jock, the slut, the goth, and the supposed 'cool dude'. While the characters themselves don't stand out too much, and there's not too much to get attached to in anyway. I can say overall that I at least liked them all, there weren't any annoying characters in the group to bring the novel down and that probably ended up relating to my enjoyment of the story. \n Overall though, this is a perfectly fun read. You won't really remember too much after you have read it, and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best of the genre, but it keeps you entertained, and is a quick easy read, so that gets an easy 3 stars from me.""",3.68,"Baird College's Mendenhall echoes with the footsteps of the last home-bound students heading off for Thanksgiving break, and Robin Stone swears she can feel the creepy, hundred-year-old residence hall breathe a sigh of relief for its long-awaited solitude. Or perhaps it's only gathering itself for the coming weekend.
As a massive storm dumps rain on the isolated campus, four other lonely students reveal themselves: Patrick, a handsome jock; Lisa, a manipulative tease; Cain, a brooding musician; and finally Martin, a scholarly eccentric. Each has forsaken a long weekend at home for their own secret reasons.
The five unlikely companions establish a tentative rapport, but they soon become aware of a sixth presence disturbing the ominous silence that pervades the building. Are they the victims of a simple college prank taken way too far, or is the unusual energy evidence of something genuine---and intent on using the five students for its own terrifying ends? It's only Thursday afternoon, and they have three long days and dark nights before the rest of the world returns to find out what's become of them. But for now it's just the darkness keeping company with five students nobody wants and no one will miss.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1122023.The_Harrowing,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316636767m/1122023.jpg,1109105,The Harrowing,Mystery,read kind of like your standard slasher movie the opening quote on the front cover of this book simply say scream meet the exorcist and that is a very apt description of the novel a a whole it mix in the element you will see from your typical slasher movie but also add a paranormal demonic possession storyline ala exorcist if i wa being nitpicky i d say it wa le scream like though a scream wa a movie that tossed the slasher convention on their head and created clever twist using those trope this book doe play it more standard and is therefore more generic than clever in the end despite this however i did enjoy this the plot line for the harrowing follows five teenager all from different social group who have decided to stay within the confines of their university during a holiday period instead of going home while alone on campus they make the clever horror movie decision to play with a ouija board and chaos ensues what i most appreciated about this book wa that it actually put some though into the demonic possession angle while the entity is of course evil it s not simply just the devil or a dead person with unfinished business the twist and turn kept me intrigued to the finale and while ultimately the whole thing is a little predictable i can at least say i wa entertained throughout the character here are pretty generic each one belonging to your typical horror movie archetype we have the geek the jock the slut the goth and the supposed cool dude while the character themselves don t stand out too much and there s not too much to get attached to in anyway i can say overall that i at least liked them all there weren t any annoying character in the group to bring the novel down and that probably ended up relating to my enjoyment of the story overall though this is a perfectly fun read you won t really remember too much after you have read it and it s certainly not going to go down a one of the best of the genre but it keep you entertained and is a quick easy read so that get an easy star from me,0.9915
