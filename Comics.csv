I love a darker Batman (like the one Ben Affleck portrays), simply because I\'m kind of tired of the whole strict hero morale code. So, as always Batman struggles with the whole ""I need to serve justice, and it would be better to kill so-and-so, but I am not God, I cannot judge"". However, I do enjoy that in this specific graphic novel he\'s pretty much at the end of his rope with this internal conflict, because he\'s already leaning more towards the ""I should just f*cking kill this guy"". Also, I was not expecting what happened to Barbara to happen so quickly into the novel (then again I should\'ve since it was so short), but what also happened. I also am not a fan of the half-assed Joker back story in this... it probably would\'ve been better just to not include it like always, because this one was just so lack luster to me. I get that it\'s symbolic since he was a normal guy and ""one bad day"" happened, and then he just went crazy and that\'s his ""shtick"".. but I don\'t know. It just didn\'t resonate with me as much as it was probably intended. Lastly, I feel pretty incomplete in terms of the story. The ending wasn\'t as clear to me, but from reading other reviews I got the gist. However, I just felt like the story went too quickly (good for the action, bad for the plot), and it wasn\'t resolved. I didn\'t feel the growth of the story, because it went Step 1: Shoot Babs, etc., Step 2: Try to F*ck Gordon, Step 3: Bats and Joker talk about their relationship.. Okay, goodbye, have a nice day. Keep in mind, this review is from someone fairly new to the DC universe/Batman universe. I watch (and am currently in the process) of watching all the DC shows, animated movies, and on-screen movies, but have not had time to delve into the world of the comics (mainly because I wouldn\'t know where the hell to start)... but, I digress. This is just my personal opinion. I loved the dark, gritty feeling of the book and the illustration was to die for. Perfect. Amazing. Dialogue was great too, but plot fell flat for me length-wise. I wanted more, but not in a ""Wow! What a cliffhanger!"" way (okay, maybe a little since the end-end was up-in-the-air for me a bit).'",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

I was confident I would still love it at least as much as Watchmen and V and maybe even as much as From Hell, but it was not to be. \n It's good. Batman's attempted reconciliation with Joker is there. Joker is still struggling to make the world see that anyone could become him under the right circumstances. Barbara Gordon's shooting is still a shock (and important since it was the birth of Oracle). And Batman keeping his fists to himself when faced with Joker is an impressive achievement of the author's imagination. \n But it doesn't do it for me anymore. It is good. Better than most writers can pull off, and the art is lush. But it's impossible for me to avoid comparing Killing Joke with Moore's other work, and it doesn't achieve Moore's personal level of excellence. Good for more is great for others, but it isn't great for Moore, and I expect great. \n In 1988 this got stars. \n Today, if this were anyone but Alan Moore, it would get stars. \n But it is Alan Moore, so it only gets .""",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

I really liked this story.An insanely dark take on the Joker written by one of the greats Alan Moore. I've come to the conclusion the level of morbidness is how I like my Batman stories particularly the ones featuring Joker. Batman's world really works for me as this twisted psychological take on the psychopath and the vigilante.Really enjoyed the flashbacks of Joker which give the character a bit of depth but also feel kinda like maybe these events are just how his broken mind remembers them and not actually how they occurred. On another note the Barbra Gordon scene was very intense and Jokers commentary was sickly hilarious \n (Oh man those were some brutal library puns).I personally don't feel she was raped but rather humiliated after seeing it although im sure there are others that don't agree with that. The only con to this book is it's incredible short which is why I only gave it four stars.I read it in like less then an hour. It could have been much longer but instead it's short but sweet.

The use of violence against women as a plot device is one thing (that I will be writing about shortly) but the fact that it seemed necessary to go from a point blank shot of the gun barrel to a closeup on Gordon's big pouty lips, to three frames of her being shot where we are dangerously close to seeing up her skirt, to at least one shot (another comes on the next page) where her cleavage is front and centre. On top of that, we also have the creepy peeping tom shots that the Joker shares with Gordon's father in order to push him further along the plot arc. \n Otherwise, there are only maybe two other frames that were obviously created to titillate the teenage male brain sexually and those only deal with the penguin's prostitutes. Otherwise fat female bodies and Jim Gordon's own lumpy middle-aged body are only meant to disgust us. Although unlike some other artists prone to overly sexualizing female superheroes Bolland is not so afraid of the male crotch shot. \n It, of course, should also be noted that in the service of advancing her father's plot, who in turn seems only really to be serving to advance Batman's plot, Barbara Gordon is shown here in the most cliche of female roles. I mean, WTF past Alan Moore? It's almost as if this rather uncreative little sketch was phoned in by someone who had more creativity in their pinky finger than most people express in a lifetime! \n But this book, as well as its prolonged popularity, are also a testament to the fact that people who identify with what we traditionally attribute to the male gender perceive violence against people of the female gender completely differently than those of us who have to live with an identification with femaleness every day. Namely violence against women is not some dramatic shocking thing, it is an everyday thing. By showing it as something unusual or dramatic, creators are actually dismissing the very everyday suffering of women. Ironically enough this actually doesn't seem to result from an author actually hating women, which is why I harp on it so much. The more a person cluelessly loves women the more likely they are to be emotionally manipulated by the over the top dramatic depiction of violence against women. \n Philosophical issues aside I do see this otherwise as a fairly average work. I agree with the overall premise that one bad day could change everything for anyone. Very little about who we are on an average day really has to do with us as individuals and we owe most of our success, failure or world view to the parts that come together around us. I don't think that it has aged particularly well, a victim of its own success I suppose. Plus it's not even something that Moore stands behind anymore. I'm certainly annoyed that of all the comics I read on the subway this is the only one that a random stranger has ever recognised and felt the need to strike up a conversation about it. I also expect the animated movie to be worse. We shall see.""",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

The comic seeks to explore the nature of insanity and the human psyche. The Joker, in one of his more depraved schemes, seeks to drive Commissioner Gordon insane by destroying his life, thus proving that The Joker himself isn\'t an outlier. The last 15 pages or so contain two brilliant monologues which describe The Joker\'s views of his fellow humans, and I\'ll quote one here. \n Ladies and gentlemen! You\'ve read about it in the newspapers! Now, shudder as you observe, before your very eyes, that most rare and tragic of nature\'s mistakes! I give you... The Average Man! \n Physically unremarkable, it has instead a deformed set of values. Notice the hideously bloated sense of humanity\'s importance. The club-footed social conscience and the withered optimism. Most repulsive of all, are its frail and useless notions of order and sanity. If too much weight is placed upon them, the snap. \n How does it live, I hear you ask? how does this poor, pathetic specimen survive in today\'s harsh and irrational world? The sad answer is ""not very well."" Faced with the inescapable fact that human existence is mad, random and pointless, one in eight of them crack up and go stark slavering buggo! \n Who can blame them? In a world as psychotic as this any other response would be crazy! \n I think this is the hinge of The Killing Joke which captures The Joker perfectly. I read this in preparation for the animated version which is scheduled for release and which will star Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill. Let\'s just say that I can\'t wait to hear Hamill deliver this monologue. And, looking at it closer, we have to ask ourselves, do we agree with The Joker, or do we believe that order, sanity, and society are good things and that we should strive to better them instead of destroy them?'",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

He was in a robbery gone wrong and fell into acid because his wife and unborn child died in an electrical fire accident right before the robbery. He was poor, down on his luck, trying to get a job as a comic, and needed some money fast to keep them from losing their apartment. He started off by trying to do an honorable thing and it haunts him for the rest of his life. It is one of the reasons he has gone a bit loony, he cannot face the fact that he is alone in his grief. \n We get the reason for Barbara Gordon\'s paralysis and her origin into becoming the Oracle. (Thanks Joker) \n Detective Gordon is attacked by the Joker who is trying to show him how painful it is to lose something he loves. Joker wants to turn Gordon crazy, but doesn\'t. \n Batman does not want his fight with the Joker to end in death, but it will if it has to. \n Overall, I really enjoyed this comic and recommend it to anyone who likes the Joker and wants to know more about him. \n I love the Joker\'s last joke, so I\'m going to write it out. \n Two guys are living in a lunatic asylum and one night they decide they do not like living in an any night they don\'t like living in an asylum anymore. They decide they\'re going to escape. So they get up onto the roof and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the roofs of the town, stretching away in the moonlight, stretching away to freedom. The first jumps across with no trouble. The second pauses, he is afraid of falling. The first calls back and says, ""I\'ll turn on this flashlight I\'ve got and you can walk across the beam.""

But after reading ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" and how the Joker was portrayed in this book, the Joker has officially become one of the most VILE, TWISTED, DARK and most DISTURBING villain I have ever come face to face with...AND I LOVED IT! Being brilliantly written by Alan Moore and being masterfully illustrated by Brian Bolland, ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" has remained to be one of the greatest and most disturbing ""Batman"" stories to ever be created! \n What is the story? \n When it turns out that the Joker, one of Batman\'s greatest foes, breaks out of Arkham Asylum, Batman must stop this evil doer at all costs. Unfortunately, the Joker then comes after Commissioner Gordon and his daughter Barbara and performs some of the most vile and disturbing acts in his villainous career (starts by shooting Barbara Gordon, paralyzing her and then twisting Commissioner Gordon\'s mind to make him crazy) and Batman must stop the Joker before it is too late. Also, we are introduced to the back story of the Joker and how he became the villain he is known as today. \n What I loved about this comic: \n Alan Moore\'s writing: WOW! I mean, I thought that I have read some of the best Batman stories around (""Batman: Year One"" for starters), but I think that ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" has nearly beaten some of the best ""Batman"" stories I had read! I had read some of Alan Moore\'s works (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), but I can easily say that this graphic novel is easily one of his best works! I loved the way that Alan Moore made this story extremely disturbing and dark and I was actually cringing during the scene where Barbara Gordon is shot and then tortured, which proved how demented the Joker really is. I also loved the way that Alan Moore portrayed the relationship between Batman and the Joker since it is rare that I see a hero and a villain have a sort of understandable relationship seeing as how they both had lost people dear to them, but viewed life in a different life. I enjoyed the psychological message that Alan Moore was presenting in this story as the Joker sees life as being a huge awful joke (meaning that life is miserable) while Batman is truly trying to see the reality of the situations in life. I really enjoyed seeing the back story of the Joker as we learn what he was like before he became the villain he is known today and that really added so much depth to the story and to the character of the Joker. The ending of this story was truly terrifying yet amazing to see at the same time (I will not spoil it for you, but let us just say it is the confrontation between Batman and the Joker). \n Brian Bolland\'s artwork: Brian Bolland had done a truly amazing job at providing the artwork of this story as all the characters look truly realistic and colorful. I loved the attention in details that Brian Bolland gives to the characters\' facial expressions, especially the Joker as he is seen smiling dementedly, which makes him a truly menacing character to look at. My favorite artwork in this graphic novel was of the images of the rain drops making small circles in the ground, as they look truly beautiful and yet give this story a truly ominous feel as these images appear at the beginning of the book towards the end of the book. \n What made me feel uncomfortable about this book: \n The only issue with this graphic novel that some readers would have problems with is the fact that the story is extremely dark and disturbing for your average ""Batman"" story. For one thing, there is a scene where Barbara Gordon is shot and then tortured which would disturb many readers (it definitely disturbed me a bit). Also, as in many ""Batman"" stories, the atmosphere of this story is extremely dark and brooding and that might be a bit uncomfortable for many readers who are not used to reading dark stories to handle. \n Final Thoughts: \n So what is my final verdict on this story? ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is easily one of the most disturbing yet most amazing stories I have ever read and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this story to ""Batman"" fans everywhere who love a good dark and intelligent story about the follies of life. \n Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog'",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

Es fascinante la simpleza del motivo que volvio al Joker loco, precisamente por lo vulgar, por lo absurdamente corriente que es. Lo cual era el argumento del Joker: el ser humano quiebra mucho mas facilmente de lo que parece. Por otra parte, la representacion del Joker y Batman como dos caras de la misma moneda ayuda a darle una dimension mas profunda (y casi diria mas creible) a Batman, cuando desmitifica al superheroe infalible y lo muestra como un humano imperfecto que lidia con su locura particular como buenamente puede. \n Por la pesima forma de escribir a Barbara Gordon, lo dejo en 3 estrellas. El comic contribuye a lo que con el tiempo ha acabado siendo un tropo muy feo, el de la Mujer en la Nevera. Acunado por Gail Simone, el termino denuncia la frecuencia con que las superheroinas tienden a ""perder sus poderes, ser violadas, o incluso despedazadas y metidas en una nevera"", normalmente con el unico objetivo de que avance la trama de personajes masculinos. Como cuenta mucho mejor que yo @slayerkinney en su critica ""La Broma Asesina y el murcielago en la nevera"", la violencia contra Barbara Gordon esta al servicio del desarrollo de personajes masculinos. A pesar de que presenciamos como la superheroina Batgirl es torturada y humillada, perdiendo toda su libertad y poder, no se nos muestra su reaccion mas alla de dos vinetas. La victima centro de toda la trama sale en menos de cinco paginas de las cincuenta del comic porque su sufrimiento no esta dirigido a su superacion personal, sino a la de Batman y su padre.

In it, a boy whose soul was separated into many pieces boats around the entire world looking to reunite himself. He encounters new cultures, power-mad kings, wily old ladies, giants, grand cities, war-loving neighbors, and is accompanied by a faithful canine. Along the way, he picks up stories.

I would read the second volume and give it more of a chance because I think it could go in interesting directions, philosophically with the question of what makes humans, etc, but if it was more just like this I don't think I could go on too many more volumes. \n The art seemed rather mediocre as well.

Alex lives in a world where is it common for people to live alongside robots, these robots are there to help in any way shape or form. As is accepted by most humans these robots are not capable of thought of their own. They are non-sentient. \n - Much to the surprise of Alex, he arrives home from work one day to discover that his Grandmother has bought a robot for him. To begin with Alex attempts to return the robot but can't quite go through with it. The time that Alex spends with her he really enjoys but then the robot (which he names Ada) will do or say something that will remind Alex that she is not a real, free-thinking being. So with that in mind Alex sets out to change Ada - he wants her to become sentient, to be able to make decisions on her own and have her own opinions. Will Alex succeed? You'll have to read it to find out! \n - I loved the premise of this story and upon reading it I adored the actual plot. The only thing I found to be a little disappointing was the artwork, it was very plain and I just didn't really take anything from it.

Alex is a twenty something who is gifted a X5 (Ada) , from a well meaning if over sharing grandmother. After becoming more familiar with her, he wants her to be herself, which means unlocking her sentience. The future technology includes having a implant you can use as a phone, a portal to the internet, and a way to control technology around your house. It all seemed really cool and common place. The minimal art allowed me to focus on the characters stories, and dialogue so it worked well for me. \n In this world Artificial Intelligence has been discovered but led to a horrible accident where sentient robots killed employees of Nexacare, the firm that created them. Since then some have decided to start a movement for robots rights, while others are afraid of another accident. People are torn between treating robots like humans, or placing restrictions on them out of fear. Alex finds help though a forum called Degrees of Freedom, where he meets up and learns how to make Ada more than just an unthinking android. He accesses this forum through Prime Space a virtual reality you access in your head. \n This volume is a great introduction into this world, where a society struggles to know what to do with it's own creation. I'm excited to see how Alex and Ada navigate it. I was worried that there would be some inappropriateness on Alex's part but he is very respectful towards Ada. Ada has to learn how to experience life with sentience in world that doesn't know what to do with that. The humor is subtle but memorable, it worked to lighten some tense moments and make it more realistic and familiar for the reader. I felt a emotional connection with the characters and am intrigued with all the possibilities the comic can take. I would recommend this for sci-fi lovers, who are interested in exploring how the issues of a world with AI would work.""",3.98,"From JONATHAN LUNA (GIRLS, THE SWORD, ULTRA, Spider-Woman: Origin) and SARAH VAUGHN (Sparkshooter) comes ALEX + ADA, a sci-fi drama set in the near future.

Her literary references are so powerful and metaphorical that she seems to be paying homage to literature. In a way, she is showing the power of literature and how it can be familiar to people in their daily lives; that's one of the many beautiful thinks about literature: it can teach us about ourselves and others around us, clarifying our world. Towards the end of the autobiographical graphic novel, Bechdel compares her homosexual awakening to James Joyce's Ulysses. This is where the allusion in the book comes to the acme; here, Bechdel compares her most difficult and intriguing and life changing epiphany to the various epiphanies in Joyce's modernist tome. It's absolutely wonderful to see (and read) her experience of self-discovery, an epiphanic moment similar to one that a Joycean character would have. \n Being a graphic novel, Fun Home must be compared to other works in the medium. I don't think it is as powerful as Jimmy Corrigan (that book had me in tears in the middle of a mall), nor is it as entertaining as Persepolis, also a story of self-discovery. That said, I can see how this was a revolutionary work in the graphic novel genre. The story is unique and well-told, and the themes of sexual awakening, self-discovery, and the consequences of hiding your true self amalgamate to a heartbreaking tale.""",4.11,"A fresh and brilliantly told memoir from a cult favorite comic artist, marked by gothic twists, a family funeral home, sexual angst, and great books.

Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian home, a third-generation funeral home director, a high school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with his male students and a family babysitter. Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned ""fun home,"" as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books.

It's the story of a woman who slowly realizes her father is gay after she realizes she herself is gay. This is no feathery account of self-realization, either. There are concrete ramifications: her father was from a small town in a time when homosexuality just wasn't talked about, let alone understood. As a result he passes on his self-loathing to his children. Bechdel leaps a little in the end regarding her father's death and her beliefs about it, but that is forgivable.

This read of Monstress, Vol. 1: Awakening by Marjorie M. Liu comes on the heels of The Sandman, Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes and I was afraid that I would be disappointed. Turns out, Gaiman has a blurb on the cover of this graphic novel! With that bit of encouragement, I promptly devoured Monstress in close to one sitting. \n Many reviewers have complained that Monstress is a confusing read, and that seems to be the only bad thing I've read about it. While the world building is dense and fast paced, I never felt confused or lost, mostly because I trust authors to reveal information in due time. Between chapters there are little lessons on the worldbuilding taught by a fat, frumpy, clever professor cat. I know that sounds a bit dubious, but it fits wonderfully and made for a nice break in between all of the madness. \n The artwork is stunning. The cover was detailed beautifully and I was afraid that it wouldn't be as well done in the panels, but every single frame was rendered with such detail that I spent the majority of my time gazing at the work. That doesn't mean that the story wasn't riveting. While the worldbuilding was a little dense at times, the payoff is worth it. This volume seems like an introduction to the entire world and story, not just a story unto itself and I'm perfectly okay with that. \n To top this off, the MAX you will pay for this entire collection is $9.99. That's if you don't buy it on Amazon for $7. I cannot fathom how this is possible. The paperback is sturdy and the pages are thick and made of quality material. This book was not cheaply made and yet the selling price is an absolute steal. \n I definitely recommend buying this collection, and I think that I'll reread it soon to get a better feel for it. I'm certain I'll enjoy it even more this next time around.""",4.01,"Set in an alternate matriarchal 1900's Asia, in a richly imagined world of art deco-inflected steam punk, MONSTRESS tells the story of a teenage girl who is struggling to survive the trauma of war, and who shares a mysterious psychic link with a monster of tremendous power, a connection that will transform them both and make them the target of both human and otherworldly powers.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29396738-monstress-vol-1,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1471648131m/29396738.jpg,51531861,"Monstress, Vol. 1: Awakening (Monstress, #1)",Comics,i never expected fantasy horror to be my thing but color me pleasantly surprised this read of monstress vol awakening by marjorie m liu come on the heel of the sandman vol prelude and nocturne and i wa afraid that i would be disappointed turn out gaiman ha a blurb on the cover of this graphic novel with that bit of encouragement i promptly devoured monstress in close to one sitting many reviewer have complained that monstress is a confusing read and that seems to be the only bad thing i ve read about it while the world building is dense and fast paced i never felt confused or lost mostly because i trust author to reveal information in due time between chapter there are little lesson on the worldbuilding taught by a fat frumpy clever professor cat i know that sound a bit dubious but it fit wonderfully and made for a nice break in between all of the madness the artwork is stunning the cover wa detailed beautifully and i wa afraid that it wouldn t be a well done in the panel but every single frame wa rendered with such detail that i spent the majority of my time gazing at the work that doesn t mean that the story wasn t riveting while the worldbuilding wa a little dense at time the payoff is worth it this volume seems like an introduction to the entire world and story not just a story unto itself and i m perfectly okay with that to top this off the max you will pay for this entire collection is that s if you don t buy it on amazon for i cannot fathom how this is possible the paperback is sturdy and the page are thick and made of quality material this book wa not cheaply made and yet the selling price is an absolute steal i definitely recommend buying this collection and i think that i ll reread it soon to get a better feel for it i m certain i ll enjoy it even more this next time around,0.9954

Strong Female protagonist check, Cats as a race check, Strong World Building check, non-white characters check, Fearsome Villain check, Witches check, Humor Check, Action check and Fantastic Fantasy elements check. This comic rocks because it's unique storytelling reaches in, engages you and doesn't let you go. Maika Halfwolf is a force to be reckoned with, she manages to be fearless, reflective, violent, and admirable through this whole volume. Maika sets off on a mission to discover who she is and why, a teenager who refuses to give up until she finds answers. Along the way we learn about this fantasy world, that is cruel, unforgiving and filled with entity's who are after her. \n Maika is a Monstress because a being has latched on to her, one she doesn't understand but which could have serious implications for the world around her. Maika is Arcanic which is a race created by human and Ancient's mating. Arcanics don't usually look human, but are invaluable for humans who use them as slaves and worse. The Cats are wise beings, who can talk, are not to be trusted, and multi-tailed characters I grew to love. There is also so much quality humor that this could also be labeled as a dark comedy. In the midst of being introduced to amazing characters, the author was able to weave in significant amounts of world-building that was presented flawlessly. The main characters are powerful women, who's powers are unmatched, and caused me to swoon. This reads like a fantasy love letter to all the wonderful women characters who have too often been left out of fiction. \n This is one of my new favorite comics, and I will happily re-read it before I dive into Volume 2, because there is so much subtle wonderfulness to unpack. The artwork was dark, beautiful, and minimized enough to never become distracting. I felt privileged to find such quality writing, and I fell in love with all of the multi-layered well developed characters. The ending hints at future adventures full of surprises, and sure not to disappoint.

This story starts mid-stride and doesn't cut the pace down, but it doesn't try to rush exposition either. Liu's pacing here is expert. The atmosphere deliberately feels like fin de siele pre-War World 1 but in an increasingly alien universe. Sana Takeda's art is both highly stylized but still functional for the story. While very European, there are strong hints of manga's influence on this title fantasy world, but without the cartoonish sexuality--although this is still full of fairly sexualized charasters--or blunt force comedy. Indeed, I think this because of the female perspective of Liu and Takeda cut against those developments.
