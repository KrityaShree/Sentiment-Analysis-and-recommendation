## Objective of the project

To yield the “Most Recommended Book” suggestion by analysing the comments and ratings of the various book written by an author using machine learning techniques. This is accomplished by compiling book reviews from an authors' various books and performing sentiment analysis on them. We would select the most recommended book based on the performance of the ML algorithm after analysis.
