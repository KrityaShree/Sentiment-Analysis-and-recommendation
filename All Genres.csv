Meet Bingo and J'miah, raccoon brothers on a mission to save Sugar Man Swamp in this rollicking tale and National Book Award Finalist from Newbery Honoree Kathi Appelt.
Raccoon brothers Bingo and J'miah are the newest recruits of the Official Sugar Man Swamp Scouts. The opportunity to serve the Sugar Man--the massive creature who delights in delicious sugar cane and magnanimously rules over the swamp--is an honor, and also a big responsibility, since the rest of the swamp critters rely heavily on the intel of these hardworking Scouts.
Twelve-year-old Chap Brayburn is not a member of any such organization. But he loves the swamp something fierce, and he'll do anything to help protect it.
And help is surely needed, because world-class alligator wrestler Jaeger Stitch wants to turn Sugar Man swamp into an Alligator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park, and the troubles don't end there. There is also a gang of wild feral hogs on the march, headed straight toward them all.

And the characterizations were similarly distinguished. I thought the mix of chapter lengths worked to really zip things along, and the large mix of POVs were pretty seamlessly woven together. Very distinguished. But my God, the pacing was weird. It zipped, but to what? Nothing happened. I felt like it was doing a great job of building to something, and it never actually did.

Every classroom needs a book like this one to amuse students and to help the teacher get her vocal chords limbered up for the day. Who cares whether there is a message here--although yes, it\'s easy to see that this one serves up a message about an unexpected friendship--the words are so much fun to say and hear, and the images entice readers to take a second look at the shapes on the pictures. Teachers or parents planning to share this title with others--and you definitely will want to do so--should definitely read it aloud a couple of times ahead of time for a smoother performance later on. I read it to my cats and dog and then my own students, to their great delight. I think the cats just liked the sound of my voice.

(""Around, round hound. Around, greyhound."") The pace picks up (""Around and around and astound and astound""), until they ultimately wear themselves out.

This book has since been a popular favorite among children and has won the Caldecott Honor Book Award for its excellence in writing and in its drawing. Strega Nona is sure to be a hit with both children and adults. \n Tomie dePaola does an awesome job at creating a story that is humorous and exciting at the same time. Big Anthony humorously plays the role of a tragic hero as he at first was able to feed the townspeople all the pasta they desired, but then ends up nearly destroying the town when he did not listen to Strega Nona\'s warnings about the pasta pot. Strega Nona also acted as a savior to the people when she saved the town from the pasta and therefore saving their lives. Tomie dePaola\'s illustrations are simply delightful as he illustrates Strega Nona as a helpful and intelligent old woman with an old-fashioned apron around her and Big Anthony as a big and klutzy man who seems to have wild blond hair. \n ""Strega Nona"" is a wonderful story about the consequences of not listening to certain warnings that could endanger people\'s lives. Also, this book shows the importance of respecting one\'s elders as the villagers respect Strega Nona\'s wisdom on cures and life.

The books come across as overly quirky or weird, the characters are extremely flat, or the plot just isn't there. That was until I read Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library. \n Chris Grabenstein's children's novel Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library is a fun, modern Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It captures the fun innocence of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory without being what could only be defined as a knock-off version. \n Reading Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library you will notice similar elements to the favored children's novel. There is the quirky, reclusive 'inventor' of sorts - Mr. Lemoncello, who can only be described as having the heart of a child and an obsession with reading. There is a huge modern library that has room after room filled with games, books, educational material, and lots of fun. And of course, there is the competition amongst grade-school children for the ultimate prize. \n Chris Grabenstein could have easily taken these elements and mirrored them to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but he didn't. He made them his own. Yes, there are certain elements that are extremely similar, but they are unique enough that you don't feel like you are reading a poor attempt at creating a hit children's novel. \n Now, you are probably wondering just how interesting a book can be when it takes place in a library. This is no ordinary library. There are virtual reality games, holographic images that can talk and interact with people, and lots of hidden passageways and secret rooms to be found. \n There are two things I absolutely loved about Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library - the games and books! Even as an adult, I loved playing along with the game that the children in the book were playing. Some of the clues were obviously meant for young readers, but it was still fun. It gave the book a nice interactive feel without requiring me to use a computer or head to a website to play along (an all too common theme with children's books that try to be interactive). \n Another element I loved was the book aspect. Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library mentions several novels across all genres throughout the novel. I love it when authors do this, especially when done correctly. It shows an appreciation for previous authors, while introducing readers of all ages to different books/authors. \n Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library is a fun, fast paced novel. It makes me really wish there was a library just like this one in real life. This may be a children's novel, but it will certainly be enjoyed by readers of all ages - especially if you are in need of a fast-paced, fun novel that isn't overly complex.""",4.13,"A New York Times Bestseller

It's an innocent and light-hearted book about a team being locked in a library and solving fun clues to find the way out. After finishing the thriller The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and immediately starting this book, I first had a little trouble suspending disbelief that the parents were ok with the lockdown. But after I assimilated to a middle school reader's mindset, the actual storyline was a lot of fun. As I was reading through all of clues based of puzzles, riddles, and titles of books that I loved as a kid, I felt a nostalgia for my childhood books. \n This book has the fantastical quirks of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the competitive game vibe of the Hunger Games, minus the danger/violence/killing of course, but also its own unique twist by adding in classic and modern book cameos. The collaborative team members and the clues and puzzles also had a flavor of the Swindle series by Gordon Korman, which I also loved reading when I was younger. \n If I were still in this age-appropriate audience, this would be a 5 star book with all of the book cameos and the fun clues and puzzles to solve. But my standards for a complete 5-stars has changed. I still read this with surface-level entertainment with a taint of nolstagia rather than a book with deeper undercurrents in meaning or plot. Still, the book was still just so much fun to read. Chris Grabenstein truly poured in a lot of child's creativity in writing this book, and this creativity definitely shaped this fun in the book. \n 3.5""",4.13,"A New York Times Bestseller

It will particularly appeal to fans of Willy Wonka and those who like gaming and logic puzzles. \n The book is about 12-year-old Kyle, who loves playing all sorts of games--but his favorite are games created by his favorite gamemaker, Mr. Lemoncello. It just so happens that Mr. Lemoncello grew up in the same city Kyle lives in, and Mr. Lemoncello donated money to build a brand new, super high tech library for the town. Kyle is one of the winners of a contest to be the first to explore the new library in an overnight lock-in. Except Kyle and the other kids soon learn they can't just leave in the morning. They must solve Mr. Lemoncello's masterfully created puzzle in order to escape the library--and there's a pretty nice prize to be the first one to escape. \n The best part of the book is that a lot of the puzzles are included in the book (rather than just being described), so readers get to play along with Kyle and his competitors. That being said, don't listen to the audiobook version of this one, unless you're also following along in the book.

In celebration of his own birthday, based on the essays they write, he chooses twelve youngsters who are twelve years old. As their prize, they are invited to a lock-in at the new library. But because the children have never had the chance to use a public library, he concocts a game in which they must use the library\'s resources to find their way out. Readers will enjoy the personalities of all the participants, especially Kyle Keeley, who is overshadowed by his two older brothers in daily life but shines in games, and the dastardly Charles Chiltington who plans to win at all costs. As the clues start to turn up, some of the participants even form alliances. Not only is this a love letter to books, reading, and libraries in all sorts of ways, but the author has cleverly inserted throughout the book word play based on the titles of books for children. For instance, Mr. Lemoncello tells them he has great expectations of them and ""to race upstairs like the rats of NIMH!"" (p. 259). Readers will romp through the Dewey Decimal System while also gathering quite a list of recommended children\'s classics (many of them Newbery winners such as When I Reach You and From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankenweiler that most young readers will enjoy discovering--if they haven\'t already.

Elizabeth was born into an age of religious strife, in which plots and factions were everywhere and private beliefs could be punished by death. When she became queen, her counselors urged her to marry quickly and turn the responsibilities of governing over to her husband, But she outwitted them by stalling, changing her mind; and playing one side against another, as she steered her country to the glorious era of peace and security that would be called the Elizabethan Age.
Elizabeth's forceful personality, colorful court, and devoted subjects come vividly to life in this stellar picture-book biography.

This book contains four of the tales, with their prologues and introductory material. The stories are: \n * The Nun\'s Priest\'s Tale \n * The Pardoner\'s Tale \n * The Wife of Bath\'s Tale \n * The Franklin\'s Prologue \n The idea of teaching these stories at the dialectic (junior high) level intrigued me. My (admittedly limited) exposure to Chaucer had inclined me to see his admirable writing as full of mature themes. Satire, irony, and innuendo clothe a discerning criticism of society, class, faith and church. \n Cohen\'s adaptation successfully captures Chaucer, and reveals I do remember some things accurately (oh, joyful encouragement!). Beautiful period illustrations complement the text. \n However, even with the guidance of our home school curriculum, I just could not find our dialectic students ready for the material. We are in the early side of dialectic, maybe later junior high or high school? I suspect they might prefer a text with an increased number of the Tales, and these adolescent readers are sensitive about the large book format. To an adult, it says ""coffee table"", but to a teen it says ""juvenile"". Myself being of the adult persuasion, I found Cohen\'s effort a wonderful refresher in Chaucer. A palatable read to enjoy with a nice, hot drink. It\'s a lovely book that simply didn\'t work for our purposes, which is probably more the fault of the home school curriculum (who I generally adore). \n Therein lies the quandary. What is the market? The serious student of Chaucer will want more Tales, regardless of the lovely presentation, and the introductory student, likely to appreciate the period illustration, will require less of the mature themes. But if you want a gorgeous presentation of a few Tales to enjoy occasionally, or impress your literary friends, this may be the perfect version for you!'",3.75,"Lively, absorbing, often outrageously funny, Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"" is a work of genius, an undisputed classic that has held a special appeal for each generation of readers.

Maybe I simply built this story into something more than it was -- I've always loved the young girl going on a quest and rescuing the boy for once! -- but I certainly don't recall the Snow Queen just fucking off to visit some volcanoes (can't blame her though; that sounds cool) or Gerda saving Kai in part because of a Bible verse.

Readers get to see how these four boys navigate the trials that are put in front of them, and in the end each figures out that while things might not go smoothly, they're always going to be a part of the fabulous family Fletcher. \n Identify at least 2 characteristics of this genre and subgenre and discuss how they appear in your book: \n Middle grade fiction must avoid long, descriptive sections. This novel does this. It is mostly driven through the action of the four rambunctious boys, but does contain dialogue. Each chapter is short, focusing in on a scene of misadventure--the Halloween party gets rained out, the older soccer-playing brother tries out for the school play, the nerdy boy refuses to go back to school, the Thanksgiving turkey doesn't get cooked. It moves quickly, and packs a great deal of plot into a small(ish) package. \n Middle grade fiction must have relatable themes. This novel definitely has themes a middle school student can relate to. Who am I? What is my place in this family? How can I balance what I want with what I need? Why is my best friend being a jerk? Is my brother's imaginary girlfriend real? And, each question is answered for each kid in the book, maybe not in the way that the reader wants it to be, but in a way that satisfies the brother. \n In what ways and how well does the book as a whole serve its intended audience?: \n Middle school students will eat this book up. It is a fast and funny story. When kids ask for a funny book, defiantly hand them this. At the same time, it does talk about things that will be totally relatable for them. The boys are going through some serious issues in a very comedic way. And, you also see how adults deal with their issues. The neighbor is grumpy because he's lost his mother. Aunt Lucy breaks her leg, and Papa and Dad have only a loose grasp on this house-full of crazy boys. Seeing how adults deal with adversity will also be appealing to younger readers because it is set up in a way that they will be able to understand the frustration and road block of all people. \n Awards if any: \n Kirkus Reviews starred 06/01/14 \n School Library Journal starred 06/01/14 \n A Junior Library Guild Selection \n Links to published reviews from professional sources: \n Booklist July 2014 (Vol. 110, No. 21) \n Horn Book Magazine September/October, 2014 \n Library Media Connection January/February 2015 \n School Library Journal June 1, 2014""",3.99,"Meet the Fletchers.

Now I have recently read ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" which is actually Mo Willems\' first children\'s book and is a Caldecott Honor book and it is about how the Pigeon keeps asking the audience if he could drive the bus after the bus driver leaves to run an errand. ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" is truly a memorable book that children can read over and over again! \n At the beginning of the book, a bus driver comes by and tells the audience that he has to leave to do something, but before he leaves, he warns the audience, ""DON\'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS!"" After the bus driver leaves, the pigeon comes by and starts asking the audience if he could drive the bus. \n Wow! I never would have thought that a book a pigeon just asking the audience if he can drive the bus throughout the book would be so interesting to read! Mo Willems has done an awesome job at both illustrating and writing this book about the pigeon asking everyone if he could drive the bus. What I found so interesting about this book was the fact that the only illustrations shown in this book were mainly of a blue pigeon and a bus driver in a grey and green uniform who only shows up at the beginning and end of the book, but Mo Williems did a great job at making this book extremely hilarious by giving out different expressions for the pigeon which ranges from excitement to anger. Mo Williem\'s writing is extremely simple yet witty at the same time as it goes to show that you do not have to have long sentences to make a great book! What I really loved about Mo Williems\' writing is the dialogue that the Pigeon is given as it is hilarious and witty to listen to and my favorite quotes from the pigeon were, ""Pigeon at the Wheel!"" and ""No? I never get to do anything!"" \n All in all, ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" is truly one unique and hilarious children\'s book that every child who love witty humor will definitely get a kick out of it! I would recommend this book to children ages three and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book and the format is simple enough for small children to understand. \n Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog'",4.29,"When a bus driver takes a break from his route, a very unlikely volunteer springs up to take his place-a pigeon!

However, the driver gave the reader specific instructions: ""Don\'t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!"" \n A. Area for comment: Illustration and tone \n B. Willems skillfully uses his illustrative technique along with the use of expressive dialog to convey meaning and express the tone of the text. Though the formation of the pigeon is simple, the various facial expressions and gestures, along with the specific dialog, allow the reader to see how desperate the pigeon is to drive the bus. This technique also draws the reader into the text by specifically assigning the reader ""responsibility"" of watching over the bus. \n C. Examples: Immediately from the endpapers, and title page, the reader is pulled in as part of the text. After the pigeon asks if he can drive the bus, the consecutive page shows him bending over, as if in the position of a prayer request, while saying ""Please?"" This combination of illustration and text adds to the realism of the cartoon pigeon and makes the tone of the text much more fun and engaging for the audience. Also when the pigeon requests to play ""Drive the Bus"" and then says ""I\'ll go first!"" and is drawn sprinting with his head off the page, this expresses to the reader his dire eagerness to drive the bus. Lastly, the pages in which there are several single frames with the pigeon begging and stating reasons for driving the bus such as ""I\'ll be your best friend!"" and ""How \'bout I give you five bucks?,"" each depict the pigeon in correlation to the response he is stating, which in turn makes the tone of the story much more expressive and entertaining. \n Curriculum correlation: I feel that this is a great book for young children in the preschool to kindergarten age group. I think it serves as a great example of how books can grasp the attention of the reader and include him or her within the text, which is likely to teach children the joy of reading.'",4.29,"When a bus driver takes a break from his route, a very unlikely volunteer springs up to take his place-a pigeon!

I love a darker Batman (like the one Ben Affleck portrays), simply because I\'m kind of tired of the whole strict hero morale code. So, as always Batman struggles with the whole ""I need to serve justice, and it would be better to kill so-and-so, but I am not God, I cannot judge"". However, I do enjoy that in this specific graphic novel he\'s pretty much at the end of his rope with this internal conflict, because he\'s already leaning more towards the ""I should just f*cking kill this guy"". Also, I was not expecting what happened to Barbara to happen so quickly into the novel (then again I should\'ve since it was so short), but what also happened. I also am not a fan of the half-assed Joker back story in this... it probably would\'ve been better just to not include it like always, because this one was just so lack luster to me. I get that it\'s symbolic since he was a normal guy and ""one bad day"" happened, and then he just went crazy and that\'s his ""shtick"".. but I don\'t know. It just didn\'t resonate with me as much as it was probably intended. Lastly, I feel pretty incomplete in terms of the story. The ending wasn\'t as clear to me, but from reading other reviews I got the gist. However, I just felt like the story went too quickly (good for the action, bad for the plot), and it wasn\'t resolved. I didn\'t feel the growth of the story, because it went Step 1: Shoot Babs, etc., Step 2: Try to F*ck Gordon, Step 3: Bats and Joker talk about their relationship.. Okay, goodbye, have a nice day. Keep in mind, this review is from someone fairly new to the DC universe/Batman universe. I watch (and am currently in the process) of watching all the DC shows, animated movies, and on-screen movies, but have not had time to delve into the world of the comics (mainly because I wouldn\'t know where the hell to start)... but, I digress. This is just my personal opinion. I loved the dark, gritty feeling of the book and the illustration was to die for. Perfect. Amazing. Dialogue was great too, but plot fell flat for me length-wise. I wanted more, but not in a ""Wow! What a cliffhanger!"" way (okay, maybe a little since the end-end was up-in-the-air for me a bit).'",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

I was confident I would still love it at least as much as Watchmen and V and maybe even as much as From Hell, but it was not to be. \n It's good. Batman's attempted reconciliation with Joker is there. Joker is still struggling to make the world see that anyone could become him under the right circumstances. Barbara Gordon's shooting is still a shock (and important since it was the birth of Oracle). And Batman keeping his fists to himself when faced with Joker is an impressive achievement of the author's imagination. \n But it doesn't do it for me anymore. It is good. Better than most writers can pull off, and the art is lush. But it's impossible for me to avoid comparing Killing Joke with Moore's other work, and it doesn't achieve Moore's personal level of excellence. Good for more is great for others, but it isn't great for Moore, and I expect great. \n In 1988 this got stars. \n Today, if this were anyone but Alan Moore, it would get stars. \n But it is Alan Moore, so it only gets .""",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

Batman's world really works for me as this twisted psychological take on the psychopath and the vigilante.Really enjoyed the flashbacks of Joker which give the character a bit of depth but also feel kinda like maybe these events are just how his broken mind remembers them and not actually how they occurred. On another note the Barbra Gordon scene was very intense and Jokers commentary was sickly hilarious \n (Oh man those were some brutal library puns).I personally don't feel she was raped but rather humiliated after seeing it although im sure there are others that don't agree with that.

The use of violence against women as a plot device is one thing (that I will be writing about shortly) but the fact that it seemed necessary to go from a point blank shot of the gun barrel to a closeup on Gordon's big pouty lips, to three frames of her being shot where we are dangerously close to seeing up her skirt, to at least one shot (another comes on the next page) where her cleavage is front and centre. On top of that, we also have the creepy peeping tom shots that the Joker shares with Gordon's father in order to push him further along the plot arc. \n Otherwise, there are only maybe two other frames that were obviously created to titillate the teenage male brain sexually and those only deal with the penguin's prostitutes. Otherwise fat female bodies and Jim Gordon's own lumpy middle-aged body are only meant to disgust us. Although unlike some other artists prone to overly sexualizing female superheroes Bolland is not so afraid of the male crotch shot. \n It, of course, should also be noted that in the service of advancing her father's plot, who in turn seems only really to be serving to advance Batman's plot, Barbara Gordon is shown here in the most cliche of female roles. I mean, WTF past Alan Moore? It's almost as if this rather uncreative little sketch was phoned in by someone who had more creativity in their pinky finger than most people express in a lifetime! \n But this book, as well as its prolonged popularity, are also a testament to the fact that people who identify with what we traditionally attribute to the male gender perceive violence against people of the female gender completely differently than those of us who have to live with an identification with femaleness every day. Namely violence against women is not some dramatic shocking thing, it is an everyday thing. By showing it as something unusual or dramatic, creators are actually dismissing the very everyday suffering of women. Ironically enough this actually doesn't seem to result from an author actually hating women, which is why I harp on it so much. The more a person cluelessly loves women the more likely they are to be emotionally manipulated by the over the top dramatic depiction of violence against women. \n Philosophical issues aside I do see this otherwise as a fairly average work. I agree with the overall premise that one bad day could change everything for anyone. Very little about who we are on an average day really has to do with us as individuals and we owe most of our success, failure or world view to the parts that come together around us. I don't think that it has aged particularly well, a victim of its own success I suppose. Plus it's not even something that Moore stands behind anymore. I'm certainly annoyed that of all the comics I read on the subway this is the only one that a random stranger has ever recognised and felt the need to strike up a conversation about it. I also expect the animated movie to be worse. We shall see.""",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

The comic seeks to explore the nature of insanity and the human psyche. The Joker, in one of his more depraved schemes, seeks to drive Commissioner Gordon insane by destroying his life, thus proving that The Joker himself isn\'t an outlier. The last 15 pages or so contain two brilliant monologues which describe The Joker\'s views of his fellow humans, and I\'ll quote one here. \n Ladies and gentlemen! You\'ve read about it in the newspapers! Now, shudder as you observe, before your very eyes, that most rare and tragic of nature\'s mistakes! I give you... The Average Man! \n Physically unremarkable, it has instead a deformed set of values. Notice the hideously bloated sense of humanity\'s importance. The club-footed social conscience and the withered optimism. Most repulsive of all, are its frail and useless notions of order and sanity. If too much weight is placed upon them, the snap. \n How does it live, I hear you ask? how does this poor, pathetic specimen survive in today\'s harsh and irrational world? The sad answer is ""not very well.""

So they get up onto the roof and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the roofs of the town, stretching away in the moonlight, stretching away to freedom.

But after reading ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" and how the Joker was portrayed in this book, the Joker has officially become one of the most VILE, TWISTED, DARK and most DISTURBING villain I have ever come face to face with...AND I LOVED IT! Being brilliantly written by Alan Moore and being masterfully illustrated by Brian Bolland, ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" has remained to be one of the greatest and most disturbing ""Batman"" stories to ever be created! \n What is the story? \n When it turns out that the Joker, one of Batman\'s greatest foes, breaks out of Arkham Asylum, Batman must stop this evil doer at all costs. Unfortunately, the Joker then comes after Commissioner Gordon and his daughter Barbara and performs some of the most vile and disturbing acts in his villainous career (starts by shooting Barbara Gordon, paralyzing her and then twisting Commissioner Gordon\'s mind to make him crazy) and Batman must stop the Joker before it is too late. Also, we are introduced to the back story of the Joker and how he became the villain he is known as today. \n What I loved about this comic: \n Alan Moore\'s writing: WOW! I mean, I thought that I have read some of the best Batman stories around (""Batman: Year One"" for starters), but I think that ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" has nearly beaten some of the best ""Batman"" stories I had read! I had read some of Alan Moore\'s works (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), but I can easily say that this graphic novel is easily one of his best works! I loved the way that Alan Moore made this story extremely disturbing and dark and I was actually cringing during the scene where Barbara Gordon is shot and then tortured, which proved how demented the Joker really is. I also loved the way that Alan Moore portrayed the relationship between Batman and the Joker since it is rare that I see a hero and a villain have a sort of understandable relationship seeing as how they both had lost people dear to them, but viewed life in a different life. I enjoyed the psychological message that Alan Moore was presenting in this story as the Joker sees life as being a huge awful joke (meaning that life is miserable) while Batman is truly trying to see the reality of the situations in life. I really enjoyed seeing the back story of the Joker as we learn what he was like before he became the villain he is known today and that really added so much depth to the story and to the character of the Joker. The ending of this story was truly terrifying yet amazing to see at the same time (I will not spoil it for you, but let us just say it is the confrontation between Batman and the Joker). \n Brian Bolland\'s artwork: Brian Bolland had done a truly amazing job at providing the artwork of this story as all the characters look truly realistic and colorful. I loved the attention in details that Brian Bolland gives to the characters\' facial expressions, especially the Joker as he is seen smiling dementedly, which makes him a truly menacing character to look at. My favorite artwork in this graphic novel was of the images of the rain drops making small circles in the ground, as they look truly beautiful and yet give this story a truly ominous feel as these images appear at the beginning of the book towards the end of the book. \n What made me feel uncomfortable about this book: \n The only issue with this graphic novel that some readers would have problems with is the fact that the story is extremely dark and disturbing for your average ""Batman"" story. For one thing, there is a scene where Barbara Gordon is shot and then tortured which would disturb many readers (it definitely disturbed me a bit). Also, as in many ""Batman"" stories, the atmosphere of this story is extremely dark and brooding and that might be a bit uncomfortable for many readers who are not used to reading dark stories to handle. \n Final Thoughts: \n So what is my final verdict on this story? ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" is easily one of the most disturbing yet most amazing stories I have ever read and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this story to ""Batman"" fans everywhere who love a good dark and intelligent story about the follies of life. \n Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog'",4.37,"For the first time the Joker's origin is revealed in this tale of insanity and human perseverance.

Es fascinante la simpleza del motivo que volvio al Joker loco, precisamente por lo vulgar, por lo absurdamente corriente que es. Lo cual era el argumento del Joker: el ser humano quiebra mucho mas facilmente de lo que parece. Por otra parte, la representacion del Joker y Batman como dos caras de la misma moneda ayuda a darle una dimension mas profunda (y casi diria mas creible) a Batman, cuando desmitifica al superheroe infalible y lo muestra como un humano imperfecto que lidia con su locura particular como buenamente puede. \n Por la pesima forma de escribir a Barbara Gordon, lo dejo en 3 estrellas. El comic contribuye a lo que con el tiempo ha acabado siendo un tropo muy feo, el de la Mujer en la Nevera. Acunado por Gail Simone, el termino denuncia la frecuencia con que las superheroinas tienden a ""perder sus poderes, ser violadas, o incluso despedazadas y metidas en una nevera"", normalmente con el unico objetivo de que avance la trama de personajes masculinos. Como cuenta mucho mejor que yo @slayerkinney en su critica ""La Broma Asesina y el murcielago en la nevera"", la violencia contra Barbara Gordon esta al servicio del desarrollo de personajes masculinos. A pesar de que presenciamos como la superheroina Batgirl es torturada y humillada, perdiendo toda su libertad y poder, no se nos muestra su reaccion mas alla de dos vinetas. La victima centro de toda la trama sale en menos de cinco paginas de las cincuenta del comic porque su sufrimiento no esta dirigido a su superacion personal, sino a la de Batman y su padre.

I'd read it again, and I'd recommend it, but in the end I didn't love it. Its main detraction is just that the retellings are very little more than literal retellings--Babel, the Sirens, Cain and Abel, among others; not straight retellings, but not quite re-imagined, either. They're just kind of . . . retold. Mixed in are some original bits, which are very good, but too few and far between. \n I guess I wanted there to be another layer--deeper, and either profound or faux-moralistic, tying the anecdotes together to reveal a greater truth behind them, in keeping with the fable-like tone.

It's a little bit of a love story and a little Greek mythology-esque, where the gods are animals but are still looking down from the perch to meddle with human lives. \n Graphic novels are obviously expected to be more visual than anything, and the illustrations definitely do carry the bulk of the stories, but the dialogue is well placed and often humorous as well. It's been a long time since I've read a book with pictures and I enjoyed the art and imagination behind it. I'll have to pick up more of her work. 4 stars.""",4.08,"Before our history began, another now forgotten civilization thrived. The people who roamed Early Earth were much like us: curious, emotional, funny, ambitious, and vulnerable. In this series of illustrated and linked tales, Isabel Greenberg chronicles the explorations of a young man as he paddles from his home in the North Pole to the South Pole. There, he meets his true love, but their romance is ill-fated. Early Earth's unusual and finicky polarity means the lovers can never touch.
As intricate and richly imagined as the work of Chris Ware, and leavened with a dry wit that rivals Kate Beaton's in Hark!

Alex is a twenty something who is gifted a X5 (Ada) , from a well meaning if over sharing grandmother. After becoming more familiar with her, he wants her to be herself, which means unlocking her sentience. The future technology includes having a implant you can use as a phone, a portal to the internet, and a way to control technology around your house. It all seemed really cool and common place. The minimal art allowed me to focus on the characters stories, and dialogue so it worked well for me. \n In this world Artificial Intelligence has been discovered but led to a horrible accident where sentient robots killed employees of Nexacare, the firm that created them. Since then some have decided to start a movement for robots rights, while others are afraid of another accident. People are torn between treating robots like humans, or placing restrictions on them out of fear. Alex finds help though a forum called Degrees of Freedom, where he meets up and learns how to make Ada more than just an unthinking android. He accesses this forum through Prime Space a virtual reality you access in your head. \n This volume is a great introduction into this world, where a society struggles to know what to do with it's own creation. I'm excited to see how Alex and Ada navigate it. I was worried that there would be some inappropriateness on Alex's part but he is very respectful towards Ada. Ada has to learn how to experience life with sentience in world that doesn't know what to do with that. The humor is subtle but memorable, it worked to lighten some tense moments and make it more realistic and familiar for the reader. I felt a emotional connection with the characters and am intrigued with all the possibilities the comic can take. I would recommend this for sci-fi lovers, who are interested in exploring how the issues of a world with AI would work.""",3.98,"From JONATHAN LUNA (GIRLS, THE SWORD, ULTRA, Spider-Woman: Origin) and SARAH VAUGHN (Sparkshooter) comes ALEX + ADA, a sci-fi drama set in the near future.

Her literary references are so powerful and metaphorical that she seems to be paying homage to literature. In a way, she is showing the power of literature and how it can be familiar to people in their daily lives; that's one of the many beautiful thinks about literature: it can teach us about ourselves and others around us, clarifying our world. Towards the end of the autobiographical graphic novel, Bechdel compares her homosexual awakening to James Joyce's Ulysses. This is where the allusion in the book comes to the acme; here, Bechdel compares her most difficult and intriguing and life changing epiphany to the various epiphanies in Joyce's modernist tome. It's absolutely wonderful to see (and read) her experience of self-discovery, an epiphanic moment similar to one that a Joycean character would have. \n Being a graphic novel, Fun Home must be compared to other works in the medium. I don't think it is as powerful as Jimmy Corrigan (that book had me in tears in the middle of a mall), nor is it as entertaining as Persepolis, also a story of self-discovery. That said, I can see how this was a revolutionary work in the graphic novel genre. The story is unique and well-told, and the themes of sexual awakening, self-discovery, and the consequences of hiding your true self amalgamate to a heartbreaking tale.""",4.11,"A fresh and brilliantly told memoir from a cult favorite comic artist, marked by gothic twists, a family funeral home, sexual angst, and great books.

This read of Monstress, Vol. 1: Awakening by Marjorie M. Liu comes on the heels of The Sandman, Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes and I was afraid that I would be disappointed. Turns out, Gaiman has a blurb on the cover of this graphic novel! With that bit of encouragement, I promptly devoured Monstress in close to one sitting. \n Many reviewers have complained that Monstress is a confusing read, and that seems to be the only bad thing I've read about it. While the world building is dense and fast paced, I never felt confused or lost, mostly because I trust authors to reveal information in due time. Between chapters there are little lessons on the worldbuilding taught by a fat, frumpy, clever professor cat. I know that sounds a bit dubious, but it fits wonderfully and made for a nice break in between all of the madness. \n The artwork is stunning. The cover was detailed beautifully and I was afraid that it wouldn't be as well done in the panels, but every single frame was rendered with such detail that I spent the majority of my time gazing at the work. That doesn't mean that the story wasn't riveting. While the worldbuilding was a little dense at times, the payoff is worth it. This volume seems like an introduction to the entire world and story, not just a story unto itself and I'm perfectly okay with that. \n To top this off, the MAX you will pay for this entire collection is $9.99. That's if you don't buy it on Amazon for $7. I cannot fathom how this is possible. The paperback is sturdy and the pages are thick and made of quality material. This book was not cheaply made and yet the selling price is an absolute steal. \n I definitely recommend buying this collection, and I think that I'll reread it soon to get a better feel for it.

Strong Female protagonist check, Cats as a race check, Strong World Building check, non-white characters check, Fearsome Villain check, Witches check, Humor Check, Action check and Fantastic Fantasy elements check. This comic rocks because it's unique storytelling reaches in, engages you and doesn't let you go. Maika Halfwolf is a force to be reckoned with, she manages to be fearless, reflective, violent, and admirable through this whole volume. Maika sets off on a mission to discover who she is and why, a teenager who refuses to give up until she finds answers. Along the way we learn about this fantasy world, that is cruel, unforgiving and filled with entity's who are after her. \n Maika is a Monstress because a being has latched on to her, one she doesn't understand but which could have serious implications for the world around her. Maika is Arcanic which is a race created by human and Ancient's mating. Arcanics don't usually look human, but are invaluable for humans who use them as slaves and worse. The Cats are wise beings, who can talk, are not to be trusted, and multi-tailed characters I grew to love. There is also so much quality humor that this could also be labeled as a dark comedy. In the midst of being introduced to amazing characters, the author was able to weave in significant amounts of world-building that was presented flawlessly. The main characters are powerful women, who's powers are unmatched, and caused me to swoon. This reads like a fantasy love letter to all the wonderful women characters who have too often been left out of fiction. \n This is one of my new favorite comics, and I will happily re-read it before I dive into Volume 2, because there is so much subtle wonderfulness to unpack. The artwork was dark, beautiful, and minimized enough to never become distracting. I felt privileged to find such quality writing, and I fell in love with all of the multi-layered well developed characters.

Meet Bingo and J'miah, raccoon brothers on a mission to save Sugar Man Swamp in this rollicking tale and National Book Award Finalist from Newbery Honoree Kathi Appelt.
Raccoon brothers Bingo and J'miah are the newest recruits of the Official Sugar Man Swamp Scouts. The opportunity to serve the Sugar Man--the massive creature who delights in delicious sugar cane and magnanimously rules over the swamp--is an honor, and also a big responsibility, since the rest of the swamp critters rely heavily on the intel of these hardworking Scouts.
Twelve-year-old Chap Brayburn is not a member of any such organization. But he loves the swamp something fierce, and he'll do anything to help protect it.
And help is surely needed, because world-class alligator wrestler Jaeger Stitch wants to turn Sugar Man swamp into an Alligator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park, and the troubles don't end there. There is also a gang of wild feral hogs on the march, headed straight toward them all.
The Scouts are ready. All they have to do is wake up the Sugar Man. Problem is, no one's been able to wake that fellow up in a decade or four...

The broad outline of the plot is somewhat conventional but the way the story is told is brilliant and very captivating. \n The protagonist of the story is a man named Kvothe. At the start of the novel Kvothe is a humble innkeeper living under an assumed name. He supposedly has a past history of great heroism/mythic adventure that has come to ruin in some way. This book is the first third of his life story that he is narrating to a Chronicler. \n Kvothe is not a totally likable or reliable narrator and it is this continual undercurrent of distrust at the recollections of our supposed hero and the clever framing device that add a great layer to the main plot, recounting Kvothe's childhood and attendance at university.

I\'ve listened to the internet rave about it for years, but its size intimidated me so I\'ve read elsewhere instead. I ended up reading this as the August pick for the Sword and Laser book club and I am so glad that I did. \n Its been awhile since I\'ve come across a good epic fantasy that I\'ve really loved. The last really great fantasy series I discovered was the \'Fitz and the Fool\' series by Robin Hobb, and I owe that one to the Sword and Laser as well. (I supported season 2 of the video show but I really need to give more back - maybe buy a t shirt or something). \n Anyway, I consumed this with an intensity that surprised even myself. Now having finished it, I\'d place Rothfuss\' name alongside Martin, Hobb, Weis & Hickman, even after reading only this one work. In one word, this book was amazing. \n Rothfuss has done something truly unique in a fantasy novel: found a way to make a magic system interesting, complex without being painful to the reader, but most of all, dare a say, plausible? This idea of \'sympathy\', combined with seemingly advanced knowledge of mathemathics, chemistry and physiology make the idea of magic (rarely referred to by that title in the book) seem exciting again. Taken with a suite of interesting characters, breathtaking land and city scapes, and at least the early years of an exciting hero\'s journey, this is an exceptional first novel in a series. \n I found myself annoyed at one part though. I was Kvothe\'s age myself once so I can relate to the idea of him not wanting to ruin things with the love interest, but more than once I found myself muttering (OK, yelling) ""Just kiss the girl!"". \n Otherwise, a perfect read.

Rothfuss's prose is stellar and the book is edited and arranged in such a way that, despite its length, it sings along at a great pace with very few points where it even slightly drags. There are no wasted words here, almost (but not quite!) to the point of the book being too brief or jumpy in places, especially in the University sections. \n It's also very clever. The magic is clever. The twists on fantasy tropes and archetypes are clever. The interwoven themes are clever. It's all very pleasing to experience on both a typical fantasy reader level and on a deeper (highfalutin) literary level. The bottom line is every modern fantasy fan should read The Name of the Wind just to know what all the (Roth)fuss is about. \n So why three out of five stars? Simple: Kvothe sucks. He has no flaws. He's amazing at everything he does. He gets 99% of what he wants, if sometimes in a roundabout way. Yes, his life as an orphan was hard but even then he was the best at orphanry. For all of Kvothe's trials there's no doubt or narrative tension in his story. Thanks to how well written and built the book is, you don't really notice these problems until it's over. \n And that's where the second, more damning problem of The Name of the Wind lies. The book doesn't end so much as it stops. There's no significant climax to speak of and all those pretty words, pleasant as they were at the time, appear to mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Rothfuss and Kvothe leave you unsatisfied but tell you to come back tomorrow for the next one. You feel tricked by a beautiful but hollow experience packaged in top-notch, slick production. But despite all that, the book sticks with you and you can't really be mad about it. \n Basically, I'm saying that The Name of the Wind is exactly like a Katy Perry song.""",4.55,"Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen.

There are some excellent parts to the book and the author is a very good writer in many respects but the book is rather disappointing. \n It's a long rambling tale covering a series of events in the main characters life but lacks an overall story arch holding it all together. Instead we are given a series of events that occurred to the main character over the course of a couple of years filled with fragmented abrupt and jagged transitions between different plot arcs. There are vast sections that don't add anything to the story or develop in an interesting way. Most of what happens between the big tragedy in his young life until after he earns his pipes is found wanting. There are a few good parts during that section, the scene at the asylum for one. But most of it could have been cut leaving a stronger story. \n Eventually the story does gets going and the Main Character and the Love of his life are off adventuring in the country side and we are treated to an excellent fast story arc with great interpersonal exchanges, triumphs, and tragedies but then it all abruptly ends and character who has just spent the last few days risking everything on the tiniest of clues drops it all and goes back to his humdrum life without pursuing any of it further. It's barely even mentioned afterwards. If anything what character growth that has occurred for the last hundred pages or so seems to have evaporated and the characters seem further apart and shallower then before. If I compared to hobbit I would say it was like if Bilbo had gotten all the way to lonely mountain snuck into smaug's lair seen the dragon and treasure and then decided that was good enough for his adventure then turned around and went home. \n What can I say about the characters in this book? Sadly most of the side characters are flat, lack depth, and contribute very little. There are some with interesting potential but they never get fleshed out. The only who is developed at all is Denna the big love of Kvoths life we get to see a lot about her, hints at a dark painful past, the fire and longing in her soul, her love for Kvoth. If only all the side characters had been as well developed as her. \n The main character Kvoth seems uneven and disjointed. He's incredibly talented, a fast learner, prideful, arrogant, confident, ambitious, and charming. But his relationship with the women in his life is completely incongruent with the rest of his character there he become shy, nervous, and timid. It just didn't seem to make sense that the type of person who have the gall to ask the master of university to pay him to attend their school, who would leap from a tower for a chance to learn the name of things, who'd spend all the money he has for one shot at performing at the most prestigious music house in the city, who'd get deeply in debt with dangerous people and ride 60 miles on the tinniest of clues wouldn't have seized the opportunities that presented themselves with two women in his life and stand so idly by as the love of his life slips away. \n All in all the book had its good points and bad, but I'm left unsure if I'm willing to invest the time in reading the next one if its going to be 1000 pages in which nothing happening.""",4.55,"Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen.

Kvothe has built up quite a reputation and The Chronicler seeks out Kvothe to obtain the actual story. The main arc of this story is told as a flashback as Kvothe tells his story. \n I was surprised how much I enjoyed this novel. If you told me what this novel will cover I would have not been impressed. Instead, the author does a fantastic job with his characters and one cannot help but becoming attached to these characters. I loved reading about Kvothe and his early life. The author covers a vast expanse of Kvothe's life and I was never bored with it. When he suffered a tragedy I suffered alongside him and I was cheering when he triumphed. This is a beautiful written book as the reader finds himself immersed within this world and can connect with the characters and their situations. \n There were two minor reasons why I did not give this a five star rating. The first one is the lack of action. There was plenty of conflict but this book concentrated on the characters and getting to know them. There are several storylines that the author touched upon that will probably have the action aspect and most likely be explored in subsequent books. The second complaint is this book just ends. I guess all three books are to be considered one giant book as I imagine the second book will pick up right where this one ended. \n I strongly recommend this book as it is a beautiful book to read and one gets immediately immersed within this world and its characters.

It seemed like a nonscensical name for a cheesy fantasy book. I was absolutely wrong. Not only does the name of the book truly emcompass one of the main character\'s driving motivations, but this book was anything but cheesy. I like being wrong. This book is the coming of age story. And an epic fantasy. And a mystery. And an adventure. And a story about a magical school. And I still don\'t know the name of the wind!! \n Pros \n Storytelling and POV - I normally don\'t combine my points of interest, but Storytelling and POV are one in the same in this book. Kvothe is telling his story to a Chronicler to write down and we are reading what the Chronicler is writing. The main story is in first person. Occassionally we switch gears to see what\'s going on with Kvothe and the Chronicler in the tavern, so the POV switches to third person for those scenes. It was a unique way to tell a story. \n Characters - One of the things about epic fantasy that I don\'t really like is the enormous cast of characters that I have to partition in my mind. This book pared that down. We had a lot of characters, but he didn\'t dwell on side characters unless they were important. There was a comfortable number of main characters, a few great side characters, then a lot of NPCs (non-player characters). I didn\'t feel overwhelmed when a name was mentioned unless it didn\'t really matter if I knew who they were. \n Magic System - The magic system in this book is creative and believable. It\'s not explained in the book this way, but I feel like there are two different types of magic in this world: sympathy (logical magic) and calling the names of things (mystical magic). Sympathy reminds me a lot of mechanics. You attach something to something else using a similar link then power it with something. One example is giving somebody a hot foot. You build a model of them, add a piece of their hair to link it to them, hold a match underneath the foot of the doll, then watch your subject try to put the fire out of his foot. The other magic is the mystical kind. By knowing the name of the object you are trying to control, you are asking it to do something for you. It reminds me of the shamanic magic in World of Warcraft. When you call on the elements, the elements will assist you. I loved the magic system! \n Plot - I considered not even including this as a point of interest. There really isn\'t an over arching plot, per se (though there are a few themes in the book that could be considered the main plot). This book follows a boy\'s life. It reads almost like a TV show would. There are adventures and sub-plots (episodes) that lend themselves to overarching themes in the book. There doesn\'t have to be a ""main plot"" driving the action. I\'ve mentioned in previous book reviews that I love a well done character driven story. This is by far my favorite kind of character driven format - reminiscence. \n Overall \n This book took me a long time to read. One month (exactly). But there was never a moment when I considered putting it down. It\'s a bit slower in the beginning until the Chronicler showed up, but from that point on it was delightfully engrossing. This book was well paced (not too fast, not too slow), it was written in a style that came across as both conversationally and poetically (which makes epic fantasy much easier to digest), and the story was truly captivating. \n The only negative thing I have to say about this book [series] is that the 3rd book doesn\'t look like it\'s coming out any time soon. It\'s been nine years since the first book came out and the 2nd book came out four years later. Fast forward five more years and we don\'t even have a release date for the 3rd and final book. I\'m not the only person who is nervous that we might be seeing another George R. R. Martin situation. \n I recommend this to anybody who loves fantasy, memoirs, coming of age stories, or reminiscence character based stories.'",4.55,"Told in Kvothe's own voice, this is the tale of the magically gifted young man who grows to be the most notorious wizard his world has ever seen.

It differs from ASoIaF largely by being primarily a first-person account couched within a larger framing narrative. As for being post-HP, I\'d say that as far as my own tastes go, The Name of the Wind got everything right that I felt Lev Grossman\'s \n The Magicians \n got wrong: namely that it populates its believable university setting with characters I can actually care about. \n On that topic, I have to admit that Kvothe, the protagonist, teeters on the edge of being a Mary Sue but never quite crosses over. It\'s mainly because he\'s ungodly talented and intelligent, but that goes along with deliberately creating a larger than life character. Kvothe pays for his plusses with a crapload of pain, poverty, and other unfortunate circumstances. This isn\'t a character for whom everything always works out - far from it. Despite his intelligence, he\'s young and frequently ignorant in relation to his peers, and both those traits come back to kick him in the groin. That, and he also spends half the book friend-zoning himself from his One True Love. \n My main complaint about the book is that I don\'t think it actually qualifies as a novel with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, the larger trilogy feels like one of those big ""mega-novels"" and this was only Act 1. The book is mainly composed of a series of episodes from Kvothe\'s childhood and university days, and the ending just happens because the publisher ran out of paper.

Well, you get the point. The Name of the Wind is tied with Ready Player One for my favorite book of the year. (but possibly longer... we'll see) A Wise Man's Fear was also very good. I thoroughly read the reviews for that book before buying it because so many sequels can be duds. I went with my instincts instead of listening to the negatives and I was not disappointed. Like I said, I will officially read anything he writes. He hasn't let me down yet. \n If it helps, I read The Assassin's Apprentice, and I only gave that one 3 stars. It pulled negatively at my heart too many times to be considered enjoyable. I got so sick of feeling sorry for Fitz that I eventually shut off my emotions to save myself the heartache. Despite Kvothe going through as much, if not more, painful moments as Fitz, it had a feeling of triumph and mischief, whereas Fitz was all doom and gloom.

Then there MORE stories that were scattered within the inner story, adding even more layers. \n I really liked the stress on money in this book. The reader is constantly aware of how much of an issue it is and how poor Kvothe is. He's living from moment to moment...every decision could financially break him, which would lead to the end of his education and current life. Such a little thing...but part of daily life and a constant stress for many many people. It's interesting to find it here....I read a lot of fantasy. Characters tend to use magic and materials willy-nilly and finances are very seldom addressed at all. Kvothe's constant economic crisis is a very real worry and an interesting choice in a fantasy novel. Poverty shapes a person...with the way it is highlighted throughout this book, I would expect that it's an issue that continues to effect him in the future. \n I wanted so much MORE though! I have so many questions! Why is he hiding in a tavern? Why doesn't he do magic or music?? What is Bast up to and how did the two end up together??

I felt directly connected to the protagonist of the story, Kvothe, in such a way that I was brought to near-tears with every tragedy and laughter with all the joyful times - I felt for Kvothe the entire way through the narration. \n And regarding those reviewers who (for whatever bizarre reason) dislike this story because of its focus on the ""typical"" hero, I will say this in direct conflict: with the current trend of ""epic fantaties"" and the Martin-esque style of killing off anyone and everyone, it is a breath of fresh air to read a story where there is a true hero (thus far - I can\'t speak for the final two installments of the trilogy) with an advantage over others and who has a clear goal.

This was my third read-through and I already feel like picking it back up and reading it again. \n Rothfuss is so good at getting Kvothe's emotions across without actually telling us what he's feeling. I love how this book falls comfortably into parts -- the part where Kvothe lives in the forest and masters the lute, the part in Tarbean, the part when bonetar nearly burns down the Fishery, the part with the draccus. It is so authentic as a story being told as a personal narrative, because it sits in my mind like that after I've read it--a story, a slice of life, with a bunch of different adventures wrapped up in it. But it has a very strong overarching narrative, and strong characters, that pull you through and keeps the parts from feeling at all episodic. \n The part that I love best about this book, though, is the one that hasn't happened yet. The part when Kote, the mild-mannered innkeeper, becomes Kvothe again and picks back up his sword. So, if you're reading this Pat, there better be a Day 4 or a second trilogy!! \n This novel is a masterwork of fantasy. Absolutely read it. Get all your friends to read it.

The boy who, for the love of Grace, fights his own nature so that he can stay with her. Stiefvater made him so irresistible- the way he protects and adores Grace, his intelligence and his love of poetry, the way he is the best of the pact, everything good about being human and a beautiful animal together.

But then I listened to The Scorpio Races which moved me from a horse-hating fool who ended up eating her own words and adoring it and I figured if there was anyone out there who would convince me that werewolves don't suck, it would be Ms. Stiefvater. \n And I guess she sorta did. There is a huge truth in the fact that Stiefvater researches her folklore and then takes those amazing stories and turns them into her own. Because of THAT, I utterly dig the 'behind the scenes' of these weres, their mythos was pretty okay. \n Still. She didn't sell me enough to necessarily want to finish the trilogy. I'm pretty okay with how the story ended in the first book and although it's not as though life is resolved, I can walk away from it peacefully. \n And the narration? Definitely a winner. I enjoy the two narrators for alternating chapters. I don't think it would have been as fantastic without that element.""",3.78,"For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house.

And almost as soon as I got Shiver, I started reading it. It took me a few days to get going, but then I couldn't stop. (It was not the book's fault - I was too busy.) \n Shiver is a wonderful book. Stiefvater is an excellent writer who doesn't write down to her audience. When Sam needs to quote Rilke to Grace, Stiefvater just uses what works for the story. She knows that YA readers are smart and will figure out what they don't know. \n The basic storyline is that Grace's and Sam's lives are intertwined and are meant to be that way. The fact that Sam is a werewolf and Grace is not, does not mean they don't belong together. It just means that the path of their love will not be smooth. But no good love story is easy - on the protagonists or the reader. \n There is another series out there that is popular right now. I won't knock the vampire story, because it has its audience and I will never knock a book that gets kids to read. But I hope that most of those readers will find Shiver and the Wolves of Mercy Falls books because these books will be around for a long while. \n Stiefvater can hold the reader's interest because her story is good, but also because her writing is excellent.""",3.78,"For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house.

She is definitely not a good role model for young girls, there is more to life than boys. \n And what is with this ""love at first sight""?

In her leaves, she comes across a crawler (caterpillar) not seen for thousands of years. He calls himself Fur. For Auja, and the future of her forest, Fur is the answer to their dreams. But it\'s a long, tough and dangerous world out there for such a meek, little thing that is both a single intelligent being, and a whole colony of caterpillars at once. With the help of the trees\' Southcrop Vision, they are able to communicate with each other, and help Fur on a quest he must undertake to save the forest. He must reach Riverside Farm before it is destroyed to pass on the knowledge of the trees, and a special gift, of which even little Fur does not fully understand at the time. Nor does he realise how special he is. \n Southcrop Forest is one of those books that I kept stopping to say to my husband, ""Did you know...?"", which I know is very annoying when you are not the person reading the book, but I just can\'t help myself sometimes, and I needed to share this as I read! It\'s cleverly written, in that is is a story about a Tent caterpillar on a mission, talking trees that can communicate with Southcrop Vision, and other insects, birds and animals - each with their own distinct personalities. I could easily picture this as one of those cute animated Disney films, where they try to keep the cartoon characters true to their natural characters, but with the additional ""human"" ability to talk and act cute at the same time. Not always as easy to do in a book and can sometimes come out very forced, but not in Southcrop Forest. Yet, with all its cuteness, it is also sad, and acts as a huge slap in the face - a reality wake-up call - where the message is clear - we are destroying our beautiful and wonderful Earth. As you know, we need trees, they reduce carbon dioxide and give us oxygen, and like all the tiniest, seemingly insignificant creatures that surround us, they all have a purpose and play a big part in our survival. What are we doing for them? \n This book is a must for anyone interested in nature, ecology and the environment and, of course a fun read about the interdependence of various life systems in our world. It\'s not all cuteness and smiles, nature has a terrible way of being cruel to be kind when it comes down to survival of the fittest. Does Fur complete his quest, and fulfil his dream of flying high up in the sky near the warm sun? I\'m not telling. You\'ll have to read it to find out.'",4.14,"The trees of Southcrop have made a striking discovery-one that could change the world for all their kind. But they are trapped in a forest fragment and face destruction from human sprawl. They cannot spread their new-found gift across the land. Then Auja, a young oak, finds little Fur amongst her branches. Fur is a legendary creature not seen for a thousand years, a single intelligent being emerged from a colony of caterpillars. Fur is small and meek and slow, but can travel through the forest and talk with trees. Auja persuades the reluctant Fur to help.
Fur embarks on a desperate quest to find the source of all tree power-the mysterious Riverside Farm. Here he must gather the trees' great treasure and carry it across Oak River to the forests of Deep Sky.
Fur's long trek is fraught with peril as he races to reach Riverside Farm before it is destroyed. Ghoulish enemies hunt him while machines wreak their deadly havoc.

They are varied in content and scope, some being more paranormal romance and some being more horror. Because they are all standalones, I'm going to talk about each of them on their own. \n The Mill by Jamie Fessenden is a classic ghost story, with a dash of romance. \n The Hawley Textile Mill has stood empty for twenty years. It is well-known that 97 women died in a fire back in 1907, and it is rumored that there is a lot of ghost activity in the building. Mrs. Hawley, last of the Hawley dynasty, wants the building cleansed so the property can be converted into a park. She hires Frank Carter and his team of paranormal investigators (think Ghost Hunters) to examine the building. Frank's brother, Louis, sees a full-fledged apparition, but is injured. While a comatose Louis lies in the ICU, it becomes clear that he's channeling some of the souls lost in the big fire. Mrs. Hawley convinces her personal psychic and medium, Toby Reese, to assist in setting the ghosts free. In order to save Louis, Toby and Frank must cooperate and determine the reason why these souls have lingered in the desolate mill. \n This was an excellent ghost story with a pair of leads, Frank and Toby, that I enjoyed. Frank is a scientific thinker and he's unsure about Toby's skills. Toby's sure that Frank will never take him seriously, and he's wrong about that. The men don't know if they can trust the other, but they have a combined goal to help Louis and clear the mill. It soon becomes clear that there was funny-business that occurred the day of the big fire, and Louis and Toby are mouthpieces to that. In the meantime, Frank and Toby build a rapport that feels organic. Their first sexual encounter was rather funny, and hastily aborted. I liked that there was humor to lighten this story. They are a cute couple, Frank charmingly awkward and Toby forward and friendly. The ghost story is both appropriately paced and appropriately horrifying, and kept me turning the pages so I could find out how Louis was going to escape his coma. Expect a ghoulish seance, two happy endings and some yummy sexytimes. \n Dei Ex Machina by Kim Fielding is a love story that spans the centuries, when the ghost of a young slave touches the soul of a grieving man. \n Mason Gould is landscape engineer on a trip to Croatia with friends and relations to help him grieve the loss of his husband, Carl, who was gunned down in a mass shooting on his college campus. Mason is still emotionally wrecked, and on a whim goes to see a medium in order to make his final goodbyes--those he hadn't made when Carl left for work on that fateful day. This will only work if Carl's sprit has lingered, as in if unfinished business has kept his spirit on this plane--which isn't the case. Instead, the medium channels the soul of Sabbio, a slave who died in the building of the historic palace Mason and his party have visited. Sabbio doesn't leave when the reading ends, however. He follows Mason to his hotel and engages him in his dreams. It's the first peace that Mason has encountered, and he thrives on it. He is enchanted by these glimpses into Sabbio's life, and even gets hints about how to bring him through the ether. \n I really liked how this book brought in the ancient religions, and how the relationship between Mason and Sabbio was very sweet and special. How they soothed each other emotionally. I loved the secondary characters of Viktor and his medium mother; they were so open and compassionate. It was also such a pleasant twist that Mason's steadfastness brought Sabbio's grieving spirit peace. The struggle that Sabbio's spirit endured was really well-crafted, and I liked this glimpse beyond the veil. The historical and contemporary details witnessed by both Sabbio and Mason were deftly interwoven, and I really got a sense for both places within the same city. This was a sentimental story that had a pretty somber tone until near the very end. I really enjoyed it. \n Among the Dead by Eli Easton absolutely bent my noodle. I'm a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan and well... \n Neil Gaven suffered a traumatic brain injury a couple of years ago, and now he sees dead people. He's turned a bit antisocial since then, working from home all the time and venturing out infrequently. On one of his monthly trips to the office he encounters the ghost of a beautiful man in a bowler hat--who is the first to try to communicate with him. He does some investigation and learns the man's identity--what it was when he was alive so long ago. This bowler hat man wants Neil to help a homeless young man in a bad park of the city park--Trist, who also sees dead people. It's scary to Neil, but he can't resist once he learns that Trist is like him in more ways than one. The twist ending absolutely made my day with this one, and I fully enjoyed the mind blow. \n Unfinished Business by B.G. Thomas was a bit A Christmas Carol meets Ghost. \n Mike Ellsworth is a deeply closeted man who's always been faithful to his college sweetheart wife, Lori, until a year ago when he met Joel Kauffman on a business trip. Their attraction was instant and upsetting. Mike didn't want to be a cheater, and he'd resisted his attraction to men for so long--twenty years!--but Joel was everything Mike had longed for. They spent a lot of time together in that week, and Mike made efforts to return to Joel whenever he could. He was en route to their latest rendezvous when he wrecked his rental car and his spirit is not at rest. Mike's yanked into scene after terrifying scene, seeing the difficulties in his marriage in a fresh light, and knowing what he feels for Joel is the love of his lifetime. He regrets not saying so when he had the chance. \n I had mixed feelings over this one, honestly. I'm usually turned off by cheater tales, but I did sympathize with Mike. He's a complex man who relishes his companionship and beneficial relationship with his wife, even if his love for her is mostly platonic, and hungers for the passion he and Joel share. For their parts, Lori and Joel are great characters. I loved the cop, Daphne Brookhart, who can hear Mike's rants and becomes his unwilling mouthpiece. She was so Whoopi Goldberg from Ghost, for me. The secondary story of Mike communing with other ghosts in his realm was excellent. He's able to put some spirits to rest, and fix his mistakes with both Joel and Lori. The end was everything I hoped for, considering that I'm a sappy romantic that wants the HEA more than a chocolate lava cake. This is a non-sexytimes read, for the most part, and the bittersweet regret of Mike is infused throughout, which made this one really somber, until the end which was rather celebratory and drove home theme of the redemptive power of true love. \n On the whole, this anthology is really engaging and has a lot to be enjoyed. Some horror, some suspense, some sexytimes and some redemption. I would recommend to anyone who likes spooky stories and plots that deal with ghosts in all their forms.""",3.99,"Gothika: Volume Four
Seeing dead people. Haunting and being haunted. Ghosts and those trying to deal with them add a supernatural flair to these four tales of romance.
In Among the Dead, Neil Gaven sees dead people. A gentle ghost guides him to Trist, who needs his help. But Trist is tormented by spirits, so maybe together they can find a way to live among the dead.
Dei Ex Machina is the story of Sabbio, a Roman slave who was killed 1700 years ago. He's been alone until he meets landscaper Mason. But because they're separated by centuries, it will take a miracle to make love work.
The Mill brings a supernatural challenge to Frank Carter and his team of paranormal investigators. The owner's personal psychic, Toby Reese, is supposed to help. Frank doesn't have much respect for psychics, but when the dangers of the old mill threaten his team, he realizes he and Toby will have to work together to survive.
Mike Ellsworth finds himself suddenly deceased. Now he's a ghost with lots left undone in Unfinished Business. He's never been able to be honest with his wife. He's never been able to tell the man he loves how he feels. He's barely been able to admit he's gay. If only there were a way he could make up for all he's failed to do....

Miller largely abandons the desert hellscape setting of Empress in this second volume of the Godspeaker trilogy, introducing a new cast of characters in the kingdom of Ethrea, which is a more conventional medieval Europe-esque world. In addition to Ethrea being a very different locale than Mijak, this book has a very different style and tone than Empress and a much more wholesome band of protagonists in aspiring Queen Princess Rhian, toymaker Dexterity Jones, and Ursa the healer. Their battles against scheming church prolate Marlan for Ethrea's throne, the foreshadowing of the coming battle between Hekat and Rhian, the introduction of a new religious bureaucracy and belief system, the continuation of Zandakar/s plot from book one, all these things are handled well by Miller.

Surprising exactly no one who has read His Majesty\'s Dragon, Laurence vigorously refuses to do any such thing--and from the word go, this entire encounter gives us readers more evidence that British society in general still really doesn\'t get the concept that the dragons are sentient beings. Barham accuses Laurence of ""making a pet"" of Temeraire, and Laurence is repeatedly called upon to do such things as lie to his dragon to try to convince him to agree to go--things that no one in this society would think of doing if the individual balking were a person. And this sets up the entire major conflict of the book--whether or not Temeraire will in fact stay in China once he realizes that the Chinese treat dragons far, far better than the British do. It\'s also an excellent way to give us more Jane Roland, who clearly continues to be Laurence\'s love interest, and who had to make me grin because as she intercepted Laurence coming out of that disastrous first meeting, I couldn\'t help but think of Marion intercepting Indy at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. \n It is also absolutely unsurprising that, meeting with intransigence on Laurence\'s part, the odious Barham tries to go around him to lie to Temeraire himself. And Temeraire goes absolutely medieval on him and the other men he\'s brought with him, letting loose a bit of the Divine Wind, and promptly snatching Laurence up into the air rather than let the intruders separate him from his beloved rider any longer. I loved that. Temeraire taking the initiative there was beyond fabulous, and absolutely reasonable given how he and Maximus and Lily had discussed saving their riders from such perils in the previous book. Temeraire\'s defense of Laurence after the battle, when Laurence lay unconscious, was equally fabulous--and I liked that the surgeon stepped in and waved Barham and all his lackeys off, asserting how generally vile it was to try to barge in on wounded men and beasts fresh out of a battle. That was absolutely appropriate for the morality of the time. \n Once Laurence and Temeraire get onto the Allegiance, things take on a much more Patrick O\'Brian-y flavor since most of the plot is in fact at sea. And this was not a bad thing in the slightest. It gave us all kinds of opportunity to further the growing issue of whether Temeraire would choose to stay in China--and to set up all the clues that this attempt on the part of Yongxing to take Temeraire was not entirely on the up-and-up. \n And we start getting evidence that Chinese dragons are indeed treated far better than their British counterparts. We learn that a dragon has written poetry, and that the Chinese are quite happy to go all out to prepare fine foods for a dragon\'s consumption--concepts that blow Laurence away even as they tempt Temeraire and lead him down some very interesting philosophical paths. When he raises the brooding question to Laurence of what would happen to him if he chose to stop serving in the aerial corps, that entire discussion is chock full of absolutely right. I loved, loved, loved seeing Temeraire point out that a dragon in British society is not permitted to own his own things, to go where he wishes, or do what he wants--even if it might be to live quietly in an unpopulated area. Also absolutely right is Laurence\'s unhappy realization that Temeraire is right, and that he cannot in conscience try to defend that state of injustice. \n The ship\'s encounter with the sea serpent especially brings this home--how Temeraire laments that he was unable to talk the sea dragon into backing off, and how he argues to Laurence that just because she didn\'t know how to communicate with humans didn\'t mean she wasn\'t intelligent. And again, Laurence is filled with the unhappy realization that Temeraire is right. \n Once they reach China, the ante is upped even further. We see dragons in the streets intermingled with humans. We see dragons buying things with a form of money. We see dragons who can and do read and write, and Temeraire leaps upon the opportunity to learn to do these things with great vigor. And we see Laurence really have it sink in that he cannot in good conscience ask Temeraire not to stay there. \n Of course, once we get to China we also start getting more of the other plot thread--that Yongxing is really pulling an underhanded plot. Some fun intrigue there, indeed. And we also get what turns out to be a bit of a deus ex machina--the whole idea that if the Chinese are so snippy about a Celestial being paired off with anyone who isn\'t a member of the imperial family, why doesn\'t the Emperor just adopt Laurence as a son? \n Which he does, and while that does make sense as an elegant and bloodless solution, it did seem a bit weak and convenient to me--the only thin spot in an otherwise excellent plot. I kind of saw it coming with all the interest the Chinese delegation showed in Laurence\'s family being connected with the British royal line--especially when Temeraire\'s mother brought it up again later. But I think I would have liked it a lot better if we\'d gotten more on-camera mileage with the actual Emperor. We only see him as part of the adoption ceremony; we don\'t get to see how he reacts to the whole idea. We don\'t get any idea of what he\'s like as a person at all. I mean, I\'d think that being adopted as a son by the Chinese Emperor, even if it\'s really only a political gesture, is a fairly hefty thing to happen to a white man from Britain. We barely even get a sense of how this changes his standing in Chinese society. \n And of course, it\'s absolutely no surprise that Laurence ultimately expects that Temeraire will want to stay, and that he begins to resign himself to having to learn Chinese and how to fit in--and that in turn Temeraire of course wants to return to Britain with him. Not only because of Laurence wanting to be in his own homeland, but also because Temeraire does not like the idea of Maximus and Lily continuing to live in what essentially amounts to slavery when he knows now that things can be better. \n There are other wonderful moments all over the book--like Temeraire getting his first chance at mating with a female dragon. Like Temeraire embarrassing the hell out of Laurence when he finds out human babies don\'t hatch from eggs (muahaha!). Like Riley finding out that Emily Roland is in fact a girl, and Laurence having to explain to him that the aerial corps does in fact include women. Like the Chinese aerial corps being exclusively women. Like all the bits involving Yongxing\'s albino dragon companion, and how she is shunned because of her color--and how she leaps to Yongxing\'s defense in the final battle between her and Temeraire. \n And all in all, I\'m definitely happy to see Novik\'s skill continuing and am looking greatly forward to seeing if Temeraire gets a chance to follow up on the revolutionary ideas he wants to bring to the dragons in Britain. Long live the Great Dragon Revolution! ;)'",3.89,"When Britain intercepted a French ship and its precious cargo-an unhatched dragon's egg-Capt.

Moonburners and Sunburners are at war, and Quitsu finds herself trapped in the middle of it. There's a fire nation/water nation element to the Moonburner/Sunburner war, and I liked that. \n There's a nice touch of Japanese mythology in this story. It's a genuinely diverse piece of fantasy. Kai is unique as a character, and her personality fits well with the moon goddess persona. Hiro, too, fits a certain stereotype, and he's a strong and silent type sun warrior. My favorite character was Quitsu, though, and I found him endearing without being saccharine. I'm picky about my fantasy couples, but I liked these two together. They talked to each other, and I get the feeling that they're soul mates (even though I dislike that term...) without it being too forced. Hiro complicated things, but I found myself rooting for Kai and Quitsu. \n In general, Kai's training seemed to drag a bit. I wanted a little more from this story in terms of action-based plot. I loved the characters and their relationships, though. Pura is a lovely character, but I wish she had more backbone. The supporting cast maybe wasn't as well developed and made this story feel a bit thin. \n The end sets up for the sequel, but Moonburner ends with a punch.

I know this book is well over a decade old, but the shift in writing has moved away from this style of story-telling, that slow burn that gradually percolates a story through a very long journey that leads to a final climactic ending. I liked this story a lot. It was a great place to spend a few hours in the forests of Sacordia. The characters were well thought out, the setting was perfect, and the action was intense. It was a well-paced, good fantasy romp. \n The one issue that I had is that the dialogue was not particularly great. Conversations between characters were adequate, and conveyed the meaning of the story and the plot along its natural course. But I couldn't point to one single part of this story as being brilliant. Ms. Britain has some wonderful ideas and some intriguing concepts that are in place throughout her novel, yet there is nothing that truly sold me on her characters. None of her characters were truly stand-out or overly memorable. The setting was more engaging than the characters for the most part. I somewhat liked the king, but there wasn't a whole lot to recommend any of the characters. Karigan's father was a decent example, but he's not in the story for very long. \n Karigan herself is a good character, but again she doesn't seem to be very developed. She's a strong personality in the story which is chock full of strong personalities, but her character herself doesn't seem well developed. Her history before the fateful encounter with F'ryan Coblebay doesn't seem well developed and she doesn't seem to change much or develop over the course of the novel in a way that makes it seem like she is a different person after this experience than she was when she began the adventure. This isn't really a negative point so much as an undercooked one in my opinion. I think this will be rectified in later additions to the series. \n Overall, I liked the story quite a bit and look forward to reading the other novels in the series.""",4.09,"On her long journey home from school after a fight which will surely lead to her expulsion, Karigan G'ladheon ponders her future as she trudges through the immense forest called Green Cloak.

The story starts with Cole waiting for his dad at the train station, eager to spend the summer days with him. A tragedy occurs when the train doesn't stop and crashes instead. Soon after the tragedy, a whole different side of Cole's late father is unveiled, leading to Cole finding out his father was, in fact, part of an association which fights the evil in the world. \n I was quite intrigued by the synopsis, the promise of a new exciting world brought me back memories of Harry Potter, which I'm positive was a very big influence on the author to write this story. The trio in The Blue Moon Narthex resembles the Harry Potter trio a lot. Cole is basically the chosen one, special, like his dad, and he is greatly skilled in sliding even though he had never done it before or had any training. Sophie loves books and seeks knowledge, but unlike Hermione, she's not adamant on following rules. Britten is not very bright, loves trouble and adventure. Britten might be the most different one from its counterpart as Ron is not adventurous, although neither has much interest in reading. \n These clear similarities to Harry Potter, although they did bother me a little, they didn't stop me from enjoying the book. I particularly liked the world building, as the characters are not witches but something else entirely. Coreseum reminded me of Idris in the Shadowhunter world, which I quite liked. The idea of a parallel society existing without our knowledge always intrigued me. \n However, some things didn't work in my opinion. The trio acted older than 13 year olds would and certainly thought older as well. The three main characters also very one dimensional so it's hard to relate to them on a deeper level. There's still a lot we don't know about the KSL which I think should have been explained in the first installment, such as the true extent of their powers. We know they fight the evil, they slide but what then? Neve once was mentioned any special gear created to fight, only to help them slide and prevent falls. Too many names are mentioned in the first instalment, I couldn't keep up. I only the remember a few which had a bigger impact on Cole's life, I found myself not knowing who half of those characters were and what they did. \n I think young teenagers would enjoy this more than I did, I couldn't stop myself from comparing it to Harry Potter.

Since the beginning of time, Karmanic matter worked silently and unassisted keeping good and evil in balance, until growing greed in the world meant Karma couldn't keep up. As World War I rages, the secret Karmanic Sovereign Legion works behind the scenes to help Karma.
A suspicious train accident and an odd stone-shaped object that belonged to his father thrust Cole McCarthy and two schoolmates into the middle of this battle to keep dark forces in check.
With only the powerful stone, a letter, and grandfatherly Norm to guide them, the trio must unravel clues and tap into unknown strengths to discover who Cole's father really was and keep themselves and those they love safe.

A crew to give it a soul. 
In the year 2254 gravity was officially declared to be magic; the scientists gave up trying to figure it out and handed it over to the wizards. Without the inherent respect for the laws of physics, the wizards poked and prodded at gravity, poring over all that science knew about the attraction of one object to the next, and dismissing it as poppycock. They discovered ways around the tired old limits, and gave birth to the first true starships. Some enlightened journalist, covering the maiden voyage of the Impossible, noted that the ship was shaped like a hand giving the middle finger to science.

Karigan G'ladheon had been a Green Rider, one of the king of Sacoridia's elite magical messengers. Being a Green Rider was more perilous than Karigan had ever imagined, for a rogue Eletians had cracked the magical D'Yer Wall which had protected Sacoridia for a thousand years from the evil influence of Blackveil Forest--the arboreal prison of Sacoridia's ancient enemy Mornhaven the Black--and had brought the threat of dark magic into the land. In the messenger service she had been caught up in a world of deadly danger, and though she had defeated the Eletian, she had nonetheless been tainted by his wild magic.
Exhausted in body and spirit, and determined to be the mistress of her own destiny, Karigan has returned to her home in Corsa. But Karigan's determination was no match for the Rider's call. Ghostly hoofbeats echoed in the deep regions of her mind, and when she awoke to find herself on horseback halfway to Sacor City--in her nightgown--she finally gave in.
Back at court Karigan found the Green Riders weakened and diminished. Rider magic was becoming unreliable, and she herself was having ghostly visions--visions of a strong woman with wild flowing hair and a blue and green tartan draped across her shoulder, pinned with a golden brooch. This woman was no stranger to Karigan nor would she have been to any Green Rider, for she was Lil Ambriodhe, First Rider, and founder of the Green Rider corps. But why was she appearing to Karigan?

I am always impatient waiting for the next installment and I have read most of them numerous times. Laurann is a polished writer and this series hasnt gotten boring or repetitive after 12 books....which is quite an accomplishment. \n This book isn\'t boring either, but it wasn\'t one of the better stories, imho. \n The good stuff (spoilers ahead) : anything about New Species and life on Reservation or Homeland is good and this has plenty. We got to catch up with some favorite characters and we got to know the kids a bit (which was well written and interesting). Also, Laurann introduced some new characters who seem to have potential for future books (I\'m interested in the story of this new Gift who is afraid of New Species. And Book and Snow and Bluebird need stories. And why was the human swat guy -can\'t think of his name- hanging out on Reservation in the middle of the night? There is a story there). All of the entertaining and endearing elements of the New Species community are alive and well in this book. \n The not-so-good: I think the reason I didn\'t enjoy this book as much as many of the others in the series is because I didn\'t like the main characters. Darkness was not a likable hero and Kat was annoying to me. I get that Darkness is a tortured soul...that was well established in previous books...but that usually opens the possibility for that character to discover happiness on a level that less-tortured characters aren\'t capable of. The reader wants them to find it more because they need it more and when they do, it feels more satisfying to the reader (cue the ""awwwww"" factor that usually comes with this kind of HEA). That didn\'t happen in this book because Darkness never wanted an HEA until the last 20 pages. As a reader it was harder to get invested in wanting something for him he was so actively uninterested in. And once he did get on board, it seemed stiff and forced (he doesn\'t even kiss the heroine until the last 20ish pages and then all of the sudden he\'s telling her he\'s in love. Really? And he passes on contraception at the end to demonstrate his sudden seriousness about their relationship? That isn\'t sweet...that\'s creepy and twisted.) Kat is a strong female (which is great) but she alternates between being angry at Darkness for being such a jerk and instantly forgiving him. She tries to push him into accepting her in his life but when he resists she immediately backs off and acts angry and hurt. I felt like I had whiplash from her mood swings. Maybe it\'s just me, but I get annoyed when female characters hear the male character say he is emotionally unavailable, and then whine and act surprised and wounded when they actually act emotionally unavailable. Surprise surprise. \n In a nutshell: This is a New Species book, so it\'s good. But it isn\'t one of the better offerings in the series. I probably won\'t read this one again. But I will impatiently wait for the next one because Laurann knows what she is doing.'",4.28,"Kat's boss wants dirt on the NSO.

I just thought I\'d share them with you guys since not everyone can find them on Facebook. \n Harley; \n She turned her head and stared up at the reflective glass covering the man\'s face. ""Whoever gave you a license should be fired."" \n ""I got you out of there."" \n ""Without my shoes. You drove so fast it ripped them right off my feet."" \n She swore she heard him laugh but couldn\'t be certain. The bike was loud and they were probably doing thirty miles an hour. She fisted her hair to keep it out of her eyes and kept a good grip on his jacket. \n ""We\'re almost there."" \n She twisted her head, seeing the security building ahead. The hotel rose in the distance. ""Take me to my best friend."" \n ""She\'s already at Security."" \n ""Is she okay?"" Worry hit Beth. \n ""I don\'t know what the hell is going on. I was out taking a drive and my phone rang. I was asked where I was and told to get you."" He had a seriously deep voice, not even having to yell to be heard. ""I picked you up."" \n ""You grabbed me,"" she reminded him. ""You\'re lucky you didn\'t just swipe the wrong woman."" \n ""I was told you were with Sheriff Helport. He\'s kind of hard to miss."" \n He had a point. She closed her mouth to avoid eating it after hair hit her lips, leaning against his chest. He slowed the motorcycle and came to a stop in front of the building. His legs shifted under her as he used them to brace the bike, before turning off the engine. \n ""You can get up now."" \n Beth clenched her teeth. ""Thanks for the suicide ride."" She released his jacket and tried to gracefully climb off his lap. She tried to lift up but her ass was trapped between his thighs. She had to grip his arm and pull up. Her skirt rose dangerously close to exposing her panties where it snagged against his jeans but she had to keep hold of her purse, rather than grab to tug it down. \n A big gloved hand slid under her ass and gave her a push. She gasped but then slid until her bare feet touched pavement. She wobbled for a second, released him, and shoved at her skirt to push it back down into place. \n ""Thanks."" She hoped he understood the sarcastic tone. \n ""No problem."" \n He climbed off the bike after putting down the kickstand. She turned, gaping a little since he seemed even bigger on his feet. He had to be over six foot two and his unfolded body held a lot of bulk. He reached up and tore off his helmet. \n Beth was stunned when she took in his features. She\'d been around enough New Species to identify them. He was a canine with shaggy brown hair that was in need of a cut. Intense brown eyes fixed on her. He had some seriously long, thick eyelashes. She sucked in a breath, impressed a little by how handsome he was. His full lips twisted into a frown though, making him look a little mean. \n He stepped into her personal space and lowered his head. She held her breath, wondering if he was going to kiss her. Her heart sped up. She wouldn\'t have minded. His gaze seemed to search her eyes as he kept inches from her. \n ""You thought I was human. You look surprised. Aren\'t you afraid of me?"" \n The softer tone he used was kind of sexy. ""No. Your driving is another story though. I still stand by what I said. Whoever gave you a license should be fired."" \n The corners of his mouth lifted into a smile. ""Who says I have one?"" \n She hadn\'t expected that response. \n He straightened and stepped back. ""They are waiting for us inside. I\'m Harley."" \n VEN!! \n ""This way,"" a man shouted. ""I see her. This way, damn it. Cut the bitch off."" \n She had a straight away with no trees in her path. She turned her head. She saw four of them and they were spread out and advancing on her. Tom was one of them, spotting his blond hair. Terror made her fight through the pain in her feet and the now aching sides she had from running. She managed a little more speed. \n She saw something ahead of her and it moved. Shit. Had Tom brought more of his friends to terrorize her? She knew she was close to the NSO even though she couldn\'t see it yet. The trees were too dense. The wall was a good thirty feet high. If she could reach it and if the New Species guard was there patrolling he could hold the men off of her with one of the guns they always carried. \n She didn\'t see a branch but felt it hit her ankle hard. She screamed out as she was propelled into the ground. She hit grass on her stomach. She felt pain in her hip. She clawed the grass and pulled herself up, managing to stumble to her feet. The sounds of the pursuing men were a lot closer. She could hear their heavy breathing over her own. Her terror spiked higher and she started to run. \n She dodged a tree and saw something suddenly in her path. She gasped, too winded to be able to scream, as her body slammed into a larger, hard body. She thought they\'d both go down but the man she hit took the impact of her running body. He just grunted and arms wrapped around her that locked her to him. \n Cassie\'s head jerked up. The man was bald, really tall, and muscular. His shirtless chest was barreled and his arms were massive. His eyes were icey blue and she knew instantly she was in a ton of shit. He frowned down at her, locking her in the cage of his arms against his chest. He jerked his head up and his nose flared. A deep growl tore from his parted mouth. \n Cassie was shocked when he suddenly spun, yanking her off of her feet. Her back pressed against a tree he\'d been behind and the arms and body pinning her were suddenly gone. \n ""Stay,"" he snarled. \n He wasn\'t fully human. She got that and felt relief. He was New Species. She stared up at his wide, tan back. She was shocked. She\'d never seen a New Species without hair before. They all usually had at least shoulder length hair or a lot longer. She saw his muscles bulge when his entire body tensed and he threw back his head. A howl tore from his throat that sent terror right down her spine. It was a loud, frightening sound, and she would have sworn it had come from a wolf instead of a man. \n Seconds later another howl echoed through the woods. The man in front of her chuckled. He turned his head and then a low, deep growl came from his throat. It terrified Cassie. The man suddenly moved and she saw what had caused his anger. \n One of the men with Tom came bursting between the thick trees. The bald man was suddenly on the man. He jumped on the shocked man in the blink of an eye and took him down. The bald man gripped the man\'s neck as they went down and twisted hard. A horrible and deadly crack followed. The man in camouflage dropped to the ground lifelessly. Cassie stared. She saw his neck twisted at a wrong angle and his eyes were sightlessly staring at nothing. He was dead. \n A soft sound pushed from her throat and she found herself hugging the tree at her back by grabbing it with her hands. The bald man was on his feet in a heartbeat and a vicious snarl burst from his parted lips. It was loud. Movement made Cassie jerk her head. \n Another man ran out and saw the bald man. This one had time to utter a soft scream before the bald man lunged at him. The bald man kicked the other man in the throat, falling him like a tree. He just dropped straight back where he was thrown. He didn\'t move. \n Another howl tore from the woods and a second later it sounded as if a lion roared. It was loud and close. Cassie dug her fingernails into the bark of the tree. Her focus locked on the bald man. \n He sniffed the area and his gaze scanned the woods around them. He moved toward her, never looking at her once. He moved closer and turned, putting his back to her just inches away. \n She understood what he did even though he didn\'t speak to her. She was backed into a large tree where he protected her. He had put his body and that tree between her and anyone who wanted to hurt her. \n A male high pitched scream sounded in the woods close. Cassie\'s heart pounded. She tried to catch her breath even as she saw spots and fought the urge to pass out from fear and exhaustion. \n ""Get away from me, you animal,"" a man yelled, before he screamed. \n The bald man suddenly relaxed. He slowly turned to face Cassie. She stared up at him. He had a thick neck and strong features. She stared into his eyes and realized for the first time that they were oddly shaped. He opened his mouth suddenly and he flashed long, sharp teeth at her. \n ""What is your name?"" He growled the words. \n ""Cassie."" \n He frowned. ""Why are you out here?"" \n ""This is my land. They chased me from my house. Thank you so much. I thought they were going to get their hands on me."" \n He arched an eyebrow. ""Who were they?"" \n Were. She got that word placement. She swallowed. ""They were men who\'ve tried to force me to sell my land to them to stop your people from getting it. I refused to sell to anyone."" \n His eyes had to be the coldest she\'d ever seen. Their color was so unusual that it was probably the reason they appeared frightening. They were a weird blue that was too light and bright to look real. If she didn\'t know better she\'d swear they had to be contacts but she knew they weren\'t. \n His attention lowered slowly down her body. She realized she was just in a pair of bikini blue underwear and a black bra. Her arms instantly rose, covering her breasts. He softly growled at her and his nose flared. He took a step closer. \n Cassie backed up and hit the tree with her butt. He invaded her personal space slowly. She didn\'t like the look on his face one bit. \n ""Stay back,"" she said softly. \n He stopped, freezing just inches from her. His eyes flew to hers. ""You\'re in heat."" \n She blinked at him. ""What?"" \n He softly growled again. ""I want you."" \n She was shocked. ""Well, you can\'t have me. What\'s your name?"" \n Those strange eyes of his locked with hers. ""Vengeance."" \n She swallowed hard. Not a nice name. It implied violence. Great. She was in the woods with a man who\'d just killed to protect her and he wanted her. She knew what he meant and how he meant it. She saw his nose flare again and the look in his eyes as he stared slowly down her body was an easy read. Desire and lust. Her heart started to pound. The guy was huge. Muscular. Half dressed. \n Jericho; \n He released her fast enough that she teetered on her heels but he suddenly bent and she gasped when his shoulder lightly pressed against her middle. She was off her feet and hoisted up before she realized what he intended to do. The word spun as she found herself upside down and being carried through the gates. \n ""Get her bag,"" the man holding her growled. \n She\'d dropped her attache case. It took some head twisting and lifting but she managed to spot it on the ground on the other side of the gate. The first guard cursed loudly but did as he was told. He snatched up her case and followed, slamming and locking the gates behind them. \n ""Please,"" she managed to get out. ""Put me down."" \n A thick arm pressed against the back of her thighs, wedging just under the hem of her skirt. The material of his shirt was a little rough on her bare skin as he clamped onto her in a way that left no doubt her request was denied. \n ""Don\'t fight,"" he ordered. \n She hung there limp, scared, and regretted her decision to come to the NSO for help. A five star hotel may have been able to handle reporters descending on their lobby in mass to keep them away from her. She\'d contacted her accountant to request he close out her bank accounts. Zed had told her it would take about a week but then she\'d be cash flush enough to last her a few months. A call placed to her mother\'s attorney had been grim, him stating a battle over the will could last years. Her uncle planned to use the press as a way to win at any cost when he\'d learned everything had been left to Faith. She\'d tried to warn him of what would really happen but he hadn\'t listened. The NSO would end up getting every dime. \n They entered a building and she frantically glanced around for help. A few uniforms caught her attention but it was impossible to glimpse faces when the person holding her increased his pace. \n ""What is going on, Jericho?"" It was a female who spoke. \n ""I\'m taking her to interrogation room one."" \n ""I\'ll come with. Did you pat her down?"" \n ""No. Call Fury. Tell him the daughter of Doctor Tee is in custody."" \n ""Shit!"" The woman softly hissed and spun, rushing away. \n It took a few more moments and then they entered another room. The world righted as he bent and her ass landed on a hard, flat surface. He braced her back with another arm when he put her down so she remained upright since her balance was off. She realized he\'d purposely been gentle when he\'d sat her on the table since nothing hurt. He released her and took a few steps back. \n Faith glanced around. The room had concrete walls, no windows or mirrors, one camera in the corner, and a metal door. The ceiling was concrete too with a long covered light over the metal table she sat on. Tightly weaved bars covered the fixture to prevent it from being tampered with in any way. No chairs were around the table. Her focus fixed on the big man in the uniform. \n She wasn\'t sure what to say. A hundred questions filled her mind but she wasn\'t sure which one to ask first. It disturbed her that he\'d stated she was in custody. That implied she was under arrest. A new fear popped up and she decided to go with that first. \n ""In custody? I\'m not my mother! You know that, right? Am I under arrest? I didn\'t do anything but come here. \n He reached up and tore off the helmet. Faith was fascinated yet frightened when she got a look at him. His hair was black, pulled back in a ponytail, and his features were very masculine. Strong cheekbones and a chin dominated his face with a set of full lips set in a grimace. His nose drew her attention next. It was wide and flatter than a full human. Her gaze lifted to stare into a pair of startling eyes. They revealed he wasn\'t a feline New Species. They were too rounded and human appearing. The color of them was what made her glad to be sitting. They were a dark brown but there was red hue to them in the harsh overhead light. \n She studied his face again with a quick glance down, before real fear set in once again. She had no doubt of what genetics her mother had used to infuse with his human DNA. The man in front of her was breathing proof of a link between man and ape. Her mother might have formed that connection in his case but it was undeniable. \n A host of history lessons on failed experiments surfaced in her memory from research she\'d done when curiosity had struck about what her mother did for a living. Her focus had been more on the cures geneticist had found but she\'d covered parahuman experiments as well. A documented Soviet biologist had wanted to create an ape/human hybrid but never succeeded. He\'d developed a method for artificially inseminating domestic animals but her mother had actually taken it to a new level by using genetic engineering to accomplish that feat. \n ""What is your name?"" He had a gruff voice, a little harsh, and it still gave her chills. \n ""Faith."" She licked her lips and adjusted a little on the unforgiving hard surface of the table to a more comfortable seated position. Her hands clasped together in her lap since she wasn\'t sure what to do with them. ""I um, just learned of my mother\'s association with the NSO late yesterday evening after her death."" \n ""Association?"" His features hardened and his eyes narrowed. \n ""She created your kind."" The words came out too soft but he heard her. She had no doubt about that when his hands drew her attention as they fisted at his side. It made her aware of just how big he was. She couldn\'t help but notice his massive chest again. He\'d probably gotten that physical trait from what she guessed was a gorilla. His arms were thick too, his waist tapering to slim hips. He was just big. ""You\'re mixed with gorilla DNA? You don\'t exhibit orangutan makers."" \n He growled low and it made her start. Shut up! That order came too late but she was curious. It had been a hellish time since she\'d gotten that call after having lunch with Paul. Her mother\'s death had come as a shock, followed by the late night arrival of her uncle to inform her of his fury at being left out of the will. Uncle Len had painstakingly told her everything she hadn\'t known about her mother and how he\'d see her in hell before he allowed her to inherit a penny. \n ""What makes you say that?"" \n She was terrified to answer but she\'d blurted out that can of worms. ""Um, male orangutans have..."" Her voice gave out and she just raised her hand, using a finger to run along the side of her forehead and eye area. She swallowed. ""Fleshy pads on their faces here. Your coloring is more in line with a gorilla too."" She clasped her hands together again to hide that they trembled. \n ""Why gorilla? Why not chimpanzee?"" He was mad. It still sounded in his tone. \n ""Your size."" \n ""Go on."" He crossed his arms over his chest. ""Explain it to me."" \n ""I didn\'t mean to offend you. I haven\'t slept and I just blurt stuff out. I\'m sorry."" \n ""Explain,"" he snarled. ""Why do you think I\'m a gorilla?"" \n ""I didn\'t say you are one. I think you were engineered with human and gorilla DNA."" \n ""I\'m still waiting."" \n He wasn\'t about to let it go. ""Your black hair. I mean, you could have gotten that from the human side but the shaping of your eyes reminded me of a gorilla and your upper chest and arms are um, really pronounced. The nose threw me but um, yeah. That\'s the first thing that came into my head."" \n ""My nose?"" \n ""Gorillas have larger nostrils but yours aren\'t, um, yeah."" Shut up! She sealed her lips before she learned firsthand if he had a temper and hoped he was more like his gorilla ancestors in that regard. They weren\'t known for being overly aggressive or violent but did put on a scary show if they felt threatened. \n ""Are you a geneticist too?"" \n She shook her head. ""No."" \n ""You seem to know a lot about primates."" \n ""I spent two summers volunteering at a zoo."" She regretted that answer as soon as she realized how bad it sounded. ""I wanted to be a veterinarian,"" she blurted. ""But that didn\'t happen. There was this guy...I\'m going to be quiet now."" \n From what I can tell about Darkness from previous books: \n *He\'s different, but all we know is a very vague comment he makes to Obsidian of ""You were singled out for a mating project while I was assigned to do something else."" \n *He has short dark hair. \n *He\'s mixed with black leopard \n *He ""...isn\'t social but he wouldn\'t terrorize a female"" and tends to avoid females. \n *He leads some sort of security team. \n *He also works as an interrogator for New Species.. \n *He was trained by a mercenary female to seduce females, then killed her when she turned on them. \n So many Species are so nervous around Darkness. I can\'t wait to see what lucky female wins his heart.'",4.28,"Kat's boss wants dirt on the NSO. She is sent to Homeland undercover but everything goes wrong as soon as she enters the front gates.

It mixes in the elements you will see from your typical slasher movie, but also adds a paranormal, demonic possession storyline ala Exorcist. If I was being nitpicky, I'd say it was less Scream like though, as Scream was a movie that tossed the slasher conventions on their head, and created clever twists using those tropes. This book does play it more standard, and is therefore more generic than clever in the end. Despite this however, I did enjoy this. \n The plot line for 'The Harrowing' follows five teenagers, all from different social groups, who have decided to stay within the confines of their university during a holiday period instead of going home. While alone on campus, they make the clever horror movie decision to play with a ouija board, and chaos ensues.... \n What I most appreciated about this book was that it actually put some though into the demonic possession angle. While the entity is of course evil, it's not simply just the devil, or a dead person with 'unfinished business'. The twists and turns kept me intrigued to the finale, and while ultimately the whole thing is a little predictable, I can at least say I was entertained throughout. \n The characters here are pretty generic, each one belonging to your typical horror movie archetypes. We have the geek, the jock, the slut, the goth, and the supposed 'cool dude'. While the characters themselves don't stand out too much, and there's not too much to get attached to in anyway. I can say overall that I at least liked them all, there weren't any annoying characters in the group to bring the novel down and that probably ended up relating to my enjoyment of the story. \n Overall though, this is a perfectly fun read. You won't really remember too much after you have read it, and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best of the genre, but it keeps you entertained, and is a quick easy read, so that gets an easy 3 stars from me.""",3.68,"Baird College's Mendenhall echoes with the footsteps of the last home-bound students heading off for Thanksgiving break, and Robin Stone swears she can feel the creepy, hundred-year-old residence hall breathe a sigh of relief for its long-awaited solitude.

Are they the victims of a simple college prank taken way too far, or is the unusual energy evidence of something genuine---and intent on using the five students for its own terrifying ends? It's only Thursday afternoon, and they have three long days and dark nights before the rest of the world returns to find out what's become of them.

Lysaer refuses to listen to her, and remains convinced that turning his wife away from the manhunt was Arithon's true purpose for the kidnapping. \n Lysaer puts away Talith, grieved that she has changed her mind, and determined not to let that affect his judgment. Talith's brother becomes determined to regain his sister's honor, and restore the marriage, for the sake of them both. So when Arithon's Vastmark archers pick off thousands of men and send the few survivors to warn Lysaer, Talith's brother has them killed under the mistaken belief that it is a trick designed to turn them off course. \n Arithon is then faced with the whole of his brother's army. \n The story is absorbing, the world well-developed, and the plot complex. I am very pleased indeed that I was able to read these books, and look forward to reading more!""",4.0,"Janny Wurts's epic tale of two half-brothers cursed to life-long enmity reaches new heights in the third volume, now re-released with a striking new cover.
Tricked once more by his wily half-brother, Lysaer, Lord of Light, arrives at the tiny harbour town of Merior to find that Arithon's ship yards have been abandoned and meticulously destroyed, and that the Master of Shadow has disappeared as if into thin air.
Meanwhile Arithon and the Mad Prophet Dakar are travelling on foot through the treacherous Kelhorn Mountains towards the Vastmark clans, there to raise further support for his cause. But raising a warhost is a costly business. Is it mere coincidence that Princess Talith - Lysaer's beautiful, headstrong wife - is taken captive and held for a vast ransom by a master brigand?

I won't say how, but Ami plays a huge part.

A storm is coming . . . 
Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life.
But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow's best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself.
Life as Wednesday's bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined--it is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing--an epic war for the very soul of America--and that he is standing squarely in its path.

And of couse, as the story details, they also did not follow Geneva Conventions and pretty much treated POW's as slaves. \n One of my favorite points the author made is best illustrated by this quote about Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. This is a fundamental truth of humanity that the author really drew out well - if you take a persons dignity away you take everything away. I loved all the stories of POW's being defiant; stealing food, supplies, playing jokes, etc. The little bits of defiance were enough to let them take back their dignity, and I think thats what makes them so compelling; because while we haven't all been POW's, we can relate to that basic need.""",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

A function of the incredible geographic sprawl? Less concern, connection, or cultural empathy by Americans for Asia as opposed to Europe? Is it the cost of alliance with Japan? Embarrassment over the decision to unleash atomic weapons? \n Whatever the reason, Laura Hillenbrand noticed it as well and responded with an epic biography from which she explores the big picture of the war in the Pacific. While the core of the book is Zamperini\'s story, Hillenbrand complements his narrative with a mountain of interviews mined from people who knew Zamperini or shared some part of his experience, examination of both published and unpublished work passed down through families, and voluminous research of public records. Zamperini\'s biography flows from childhood, through high school athletics, NCAA track competition, the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the army air corps, crashing, floating with the Pacific currents, capture by Japan, imprisonment, the end of the war, release, PTSD, and a spiritual awakening that beckons him to forgiveness and peace! \n The writing was good, and the overall story had the \'feel\' of authenticity when compared with other accounts from WWII. The reality is, everyone who survived had a story, and a nagging anxiety regarding why they made it and others didn\'t. Maybe they didn\'t have as long a story as Zamperini, or weren\'t the story teller he was - there is no doubt in my mind that the man has the gift of verbal modulation - but there is a story. Accounts of war and tremendous suffering, such as took place in the POW or concentration camps, often sound incredible to those who have not known the anguish humanity is capable of enduring, and those who have survived them are generally reluctant to discuss them with innocents resistant to their alarm. The last 20% of the book (I read on ebook so my page assessment may be off) was citations. I thought complaints about sourcing and reliability are unfounded, and I\'m not willing to hold Zamperini\'s narrative gifts against him. \n The experience of the army air corps in the Pacific was sobering. The deep trauma of Japanese POWs was articulated to a level I had not known. Furthermore, the consequences of the US-Japanese alliance - the sacrifice of justice for POWs was disturbing. Yet who can argue with the results that were won by these men? A strong, enduring alliance has been forged between the two countries. Reading this book, though, helped me to understand the enduring animosity toward Japan by some in the Greatest Generation. \n The trauma of the war didn\'t end with the agreement between powers, at least not for the soldiers. No one should dismiss this as a ""Jesus book."" While it is true that Christianity played a significant role in turning Zamperini from the destructive road down which war trauma was leading him and restored to him his vivacious, garrulous personality, it is clear that Hillenbrand herself is not a believer. I found her \'outside the fold\' coverage of Billy Graham to be balanced, fair and fascinating. \n In recent years, it has become fashionable to question the USA\'s use of the atomic bomb. No one doubts it was a sobering decision. The testimony of the POWs documented here seem to strongly support President Truman\'s difficult decision. In case of invasion, the POWs were living under a kill order, with thousands of men being moved and/ or prepared for execution. These orders had been carried out in case of invasion earlier in the war. The Japanese people, indoctrinated with a strong cultural resistance to surrender, were preparing to defend their island to the last men (elderly), women and children. The losses in the war were already tremendous and over a hundred thousand POWs were crying out for liberation. The loss of Japanese life from the bombs was horrific, but the equation that states it may have saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Allied, particularly US lives, seems reasonable. \n Finally, I was captivated by the author herself as she shared within the notes of the book her own monumental struggle to write while wrestling with debilitating chronic illness. Her personal story was an encouragement to me, her writing an education. I have included some links below if you would like to know more of her. \n After reading about the war from a soldier\'s perspective, I had to finally tackle David McCoullough\'s biography of Truman to seek insight into the man that liberated the Japanese POWs. \n Truman, McCoullough, 1992 \n https://www.goodreads.com/review/edit... \n More on the Pacific theater of World War II, particularly the Doolittle Raid, and Japan after the war: \n Jacob DeShazer, Benge & Benge, 2009 \n https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... \n Another woman who completed a similar quest to document a subject\'s memoirs within the historical context of their time, but on a completely different topic see: \n The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Skloot, 2010 \n https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... \n LAURA HILLENBRAND \n An article describing the Author\'s descent into illness.... \n A Sudden Illness, Hillenbrand, 2003 \n http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/200... \n Leaving Frailty Behind: An interview with Laura Hillenbrand, Stanford Medical Review, Costello, 2016 \n http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2016summe...'",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

Probably the best book I have read this year. \n ""Unbroken"" was our book club choice for the month, and I picked it up somewhat reluctantly. It seemed awfully big and I worried it would be too slow and too depressing. How glad I am that it was chosen! I am going to buy a permanent copy to keep and maybe one for my Dad for Christmas. \n The book follows the life of Louis Zamperini, a troubled youth turned Olympic runner. He is preparing for the next Olympic games when Pearl Harbor arrives and the country is thrown into war. Louie becomes a reluctant bombardier on a B-24 Liberator. It follows his time as an active soldier, his unfortunate crash, dealing with sharks for weeks on end and no food or water, a horrifying internment in a Japanese POW camp, and his journey home seeking healing and redemption. I am leaving out spoiler after spoiler, giving as little information as possible so as not to ruin anything. But what a life! \n And what a writer Laura Hillenbrand is. Here is a woman who struggles with severe chronic fatigue and yet was able to slowly produce this incredible work. I have read much non-fiction, I have read WW2 books, Holocaust books, etc etc, but never have I felt so sucked into someone\'s life. I felt what Louie felt. As his plane is going down over the Pacific and he and his crewmates stare at each other in horror, I truly felt that horror. I caught myself breathing fast with my heart banging against my chest. Again and again I felt like I was there, living it with them. I will also say that Hillenbrand strikes such an important balance--she lays out the gravity of the situation without tipping into graphic unnecessary shock value. There were many times I could hardly stop turning the pages. Amazing that it is a true story. \n The ending of the book deals so much with forgiveness and redemption. Louis has an understandably difficult time rejoining society at the close of the war. I could not help but compare my own Grandfather, who saw such terrible things in the Pacific theater and turned to alcohol to try to deal with the pain once he came home. \n I closed the book inspired, hopeful, and touched by his life and choices. I encourage anyone to read this important story.'",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

It answered so many questions for me-formost my own father\'s prejudices and his own triumph over these prejudices. My seven year old father was playing football on a Sunday morning when he rushed home after hearing Pearl Harbor had been bombed. He grew up with the stories of Pacific WWII POWs. I never understood why he wouldn\'t buy a Japanese car--but now I do and now I appreciate that the day came when he made a conscientious choice to let that prejudice go. \n When I was seventeen years old, Mr. Kono, my Japanese host, called me into his dining room to present me with a scroll that read peace. He told me that he could not forgive and forget what the Americans did to his people but his daughter and me--we needed to forget. How wise and tender that moment has become to me. When I read this book, I felt a backlash towards Mr. Kono\'s resentment, but yet immediately thought of Japanese Americans who were mistreated by Americans--and then an awakening that this is not a cultural/country problem, but a humanity problem. \n Zamperini only overcame his hate by the power of Jesus Christ.

It was largely responsible for his survival through hardships of being adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a rapidly dwindling raft, fighting starvation, avoiding sharks, capture by the Japanese and captivity, brutality and more starvation in a POW camp for over two years until Allied liberation after the surrender of Japan in 1945. \n Raised by Italian immigrants in the small coastal town of Torrance, California, Louie ran everywhere, got into fights as well as small time burglaries and pranks. His older brother Pete saw his potential and encouraged him to pursue track throughout high school and consider running professionally. Running was the saving grace of Louie\'s early life and it finally led him to compete in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, where Jesse Owens emerged triumphant in sight of the enraged Hitler. Speaking of Hitler, he was actually impressed by the young white athlete. Hitler reached out his hand from his stand above. ""You\'re the boy with the fast finish,"" he said to Louie, who reached up and, too low to shake the Fuhrer\'s hand, touched his fingers. \n When World War II arrived Louie, as well as millions of other young men, enlisted. He became a bombardier in the Army Air Corps and flew with his good friend and pilot Allen \'Phil\' Phillips. When their plane was shot down, only three survived--Louie, Phil and another crew member they called Mac. They clung to a small raft and held onto their meager provisions, which included a few pieces of chocolate. Louie and Phil wanted to ration the chocolate to last at least a few days but on the morning after the first night they saw that all the chocolate was gone. Mac had a guilty look on his face. Louie\'s and Phil\'s attitudes to the same circumstances differed from Mac and they were able to survive while he succumbed to despair. Mac began wasting away. Nevertheless, he redeemed himself to the point that, without his help, Louie would not have been able to fend away a huge shark. Mac became heroic just before he started dying. \n Rescued by the wrong side, Louie and Phil were taken first to Kwajelein, known as \'execution island,\' due to its reputation for murdering most of its POWs, then to Naoestsu, on the western coast of Japan. One of the commanding officers, Mutsuhiro Watanabe, nicknamed \'the Bird\', had a reputation for sadism and brutality even among other Japanese officers, once he realized the notoriety of Louie\'s previous life, he made it a point of pride to single him out and break his will. Two things Louie would never allow himself to do: bow to \'the Bird\' or avert his gaze from the Bird\'s eyes, even after doing so certainly resulted in additional beatings. \n Hillenbrand explains the attitude of the Japanese soldiers: \n \'Few societies treasured dignity, and feared humiliation, as did the Japanese, for whom a loss of honor could merit suicide. This is likely one of the reasons why Japanese soldiers in World War II debased their prisoners with such zeal, seeking to take from them that which was most painful and destructive to lose. On Kwajalein, Louie and Phil learned a dark truth known to the doomed in Hitler\'s death camps, the slaves of the American South, and a hundred other generations of betrayed people. Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it, even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man\'s soul in his body long past the point at which the body should have surrendered it. The loss of it can carry a man off as surely as thirst, hunger, exposure, and asphyxiation, and with greater cruelty. In places like Kwajalein, degradation could be as lethal as a bullet.\' \n As word spread that the Allies were encroaching through enemy lines in the Pacific, the POWs were not encouraged. In addition to the daily beatings, starvation and subhuman conditions, they heard repeatedly that the Japanese would execute all of the prisoners before they would surrender. Finally, after word spread that two atom bombs had been dropped and the end was in sight, the POWs were liberated and free to leave the camp. All of the camp commanders fled. \n Hillenbrand spends much of the last portion of the book chronicling Louie\'s post-war life, the post-traumatic stress that sabotaged any attempt at a prosperous life as Louie almost completely destroyed his marriage and neglected his wife and small children, sinking deeper into alcoholism. He suffered nightmares of the Bird torturing him and became obsessed with the idea of tracking him down and killing him. His wife\'s repeated suggestions to check out the young evangelist Billy Graham were largely rebuffed until he grudgingly attended one of Graham\'s revivals and eventually surrendered his hatred and finally stopped having nightmares of the Bird altogether. Hillenbrand describes the self-torment of vengefulness: \n \'The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when they make their tormenters suffer. In seeking the Bird\'s death to free himself, Louie had chained himself, once again, to his tyrant. During the war, the Bird had been unwilling to get go of Louie; after the war, Louie was unable to let go of the Bird.\' \n Hillenbrand also traces the journey through the years of the Bird, who became a fugitive, trying to lose himself in a false identity as more and more war criminals were hunted down, tried and convicted. As the post-war climate changed and the United States helped Japan rebuild its economy, Japan became an ally and the attitude toward war criminals became more merciful. Long thought to have been dead, the Bird finally came out of hiding and resumed his life under his true identity. \n When Louie learned that the Bird was still alive, he decided he would attempt to track him down not to kill him but to forgive him. Although at one time open to meeting Louie again, the Bird finally refused to see him, softening his tone but still falling short of a complete, honest confession free of rationalization. \n The book is sprinkled generously by quotes from Louie telling his story. Never does he come across as self-congratulatory and he never presents himself as anything extraordinary. He has an even-handed acceptance of his shortcomings. Hillenbrand also maintains a neutral tone, impartially recounting the experiences without letting a personal opinion slip through. She does spend a bit more time on the worrying parents, sisters and brother than I would have preferred. I know that it\'s necessary to paint the complete picture of what those at home experienced but there\'s nothing they experienced that thousands of other families of POWs did as well. It is what Louie did that is extraordinary, that makes him worthy of being the subject of a book about his life. However, that is a minor quibble. Louis Zamperini is a hero not only because he survived a devastating series of hardships but because he also managed to turn his life around before allowing the war to make him another post-war casualty.'",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

Hillenbrand retold a slice of the Pacific theater with all of its horrors and victories through Louie Zamperini\'s POV. Loui\'s own personal story is quite incredible, and at times I couldn\'t believe what I was reading. Although I\'ve read a few books on WWII and even on the Pacific Theater, I had not read a book that unearthed all of the horrors of the Japanese. I couldnt shake off the kill-all policy in my mind: Japanese would obliterate the POW camp if there was prospect of an Allied liberation. Hillenbrand also tried to make sense of the Japanese belief of such brutal treatments. I cried when the nice Japanese soldiers helped the Allied POWs (the first Japs that picked up Phil and Louie, Kawamura, Kano). I cheered when the POWs still defied their captors by stealing (""University of Thievery alumni""), destroying trains and cargo, and passing along pieces of information (Bill Harris). When the stolen goods were traded as currency in their camp microcosm of an economy, I was irritated when the Scots POWs made hard bargains on their stolen sugar ((like really? Y\'all are all prisoners there together- why be so harsh)). But I was consoled to learn that they also donated a quarter of their commodities to the sick POWs. I was surprised that POWs still kept rankings - deferring to the highest ranking officer in the camp, regardless of nationality. And finally, I was devastated to learn how perilous being an airman then: a 40 mission requirement with almost a 70% chance to not return. \n This book was so beautifully written. Seemingly random events would be described when they didn\'t contribute to the overall plot, until I read they somehow contributed as a strong flashback later in the story. It was as if the reader was also experiencing the flashback along with Louie rather than reading Louie experiencing this memory. These chronological memories intertwined the beginning to the end of the story. \n Although I knew this was a nonfiction book, I was originally a little disconnected from the book, from the history. But it wasn\'t until I read about a young injured airman at sea, something Reading, willingly giving up his life jacket to his healthier comrade and then ""sinking away"". He was 21. Reading this as a 20 year old, I was suddenly shaken at the reality of young soldiers of WWII.

While reading I then realized it must be about an athlete who wants to win a medal at the Olympics, then I decided ,no this book must be about the second world war.....After reading more I knew it, Finally this is a book about people that try to survive on a raft in the pacific. Again something happened and now I know, this is about prisoners of war camps and camps like Ofuna. \n Well I can inform you, it is about all the things I mentioned and I have only read 41 % so go figure!!! wow! \n Update: 13 August 2013. \n Finished this book yesterday morning. \n Wow what a story! \n Okay I might hurt some people\'s feelings when is say this and that is not my intention so bare with me. \n I live in The Netherlands, mum is English but we spoke Dutch and I grew up here. \n Now from very early on I remember there was much talk at school and on TV about the second world war. Later when I grew up I\'ve watched many TV programs about the as we call it concentration camps and about all the Jewish people that were murdered there. \n There was also a lot of information about people that hid Jewish people (I do not like the word Jews) like Anne Frank and people that helped them try to escape the Germans. \n So when I started reading this book and learned more about what had happened in Japan, the first question that was formed was""Huh why did I not know this""? \n Was it because I did not pay attention in school? Do not think so because as a child I was fascinated by death and horror. (blushes) \n So I think this must mean there is not near as much interest and coverage about the death camps in japan although I do know a lot of Dutch men were captured and murdered there. \n It scares and angers me that Japan has managed to get away with so many things and some are even still denying all that has happened. \n It annoys me even more that the US government can make deals in names of in this instance, POW\'s and agree with japan that they are not entitled to blame Japan or get any compensation money for all they had to endure. \n Who do they bloody think they are!!! \n Okay calm down Marlene. \n Back to the book. As I said in the beginning, had no clue what this was about which makes it even more fun. \n This author is a wonderful writer. It felt like I was there, She kept me interested and wanting to know more. \n The story about the shipwreck was so hard to read. I was so happy when they were saved. (I thought). How sad that that was just a tip of the iceberg. \n This is a fantastic book.

Picked up by the Japanese, he was interred in a prison camp ruled by a sadist who took a particular interest in torturing him, and I won\'t tell you more except to say Louis Zamperini survived those and further horrors to become a man whose story should be known. \n Laura Hillenbrand, the author of Seabiscuit, tells Louis\' story without histrionics, but with a compelling style. She certainly knows how to write about running, and her eye for detail also takes us into the\' worlds of war, prison camps, and returning vets without unnecessary shock but with an honesty that makes Unbroken an emotional thriller. \n There have been some interesting questions raised about the reliability of Louis\' memory in that the details are so shocking. I suspect there are embellishments here and there, but I\'d be hard pressed to say just where. The entire story is very well documented, so I\'m willing to give the benefit of the doubt. \n The one flaw, for me, was the abrupt ending of the main narrative and the jump to an epilogue. It seemed too abrupt - especially given the detail of the preceding chapters, but I was drawn quickly back into the flow.. \n I\'ve always thought redemption the subject of the greatest art, and though this isn\'t great art redemption elevates it way beyond the reportage it could have been. \n A helluva read.'",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

I was looking forward to diving in, and it did not disappoint. \n Unbroken is the true story of Louis Zamperini, destined to be the world's fastest miler. He spent his childhood getting into one scrape after another and seemed destined to be a failure until he discovered running. He participated in the 1936 Olympics (presided over by Hitler) but would be in his prime at the 1940 and 1944 Olympics. Sadly, the 1940 Games were cancelled, and he was otherwise occupied in 1944. \n When World War II broke out, Zamperini enlisted in the Army Air Forces and was stationed in Hawaii. While flying in a plane over the Pacific to rescue another plane that had not returned from a mission, Zamperini and his crewmates crash-landed in the ocean. Amazingly, he and the two other survivors floated on a life raft for 47 days--drinking rain water, eating raw fish and birds they caught with their hands, and telling stories to keep themselves sanee--before drifting to one of the Marshall islands, where they were captured by the Japanese. \n This is nonfiction at its best: I learned about running, life in the army during World War II (and how many planes went down when they were not in combat), and survival in a brutal Japanese POW camp. Heavy on narrative and light on dialogue, the book drags for some readers (especially during the descriptions of the airplanes and combat flights), but I found the book to be completely gripping. \n When Zamperini returns to the U.S., he suffers from alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder, which in those days was not talked about much less treated. \n Of course, the most fascinating thing about the book is knowing that it's a true story and Louis Zamperini survived what seemed humanly impossible to endure...first while being lost at sea without food or water, somehow missing the circling and lunging sharks, and then while enduring brutal, horrific treatment at the hands of the Japanese guards, who believed it was shameful to be a POW and so took out their scorn in violent, inhumane ways. \n After living in Japan and being welcomed by the Japanese people, it's hard to read about the brutality during the war. But Zamperini was able to forgive his Japanese captors and eventually returned to Japan, once to see his guards and extend an olive branch, and again to carry the torch at the Nagano Olympics. \n Zamperini is in fact still alive and kicking, at age 95.

I'll be the first to embarrassingly admit that I didn't pay much attention in history class when I was younger. Nor did I care much about it. But as I read, all I kept thinking was, EVERYONE needs to read this. The entire book is set around WW2, focusing specifically on the battle with Japan. \n The story starts off with the boyish childhood of Louis Zamperini: who his family is, where they are from, and where he grows up: Torrance, CA. It goes on to reveal how he turns his unruly life around when he becomes focused on running and his goal to enter the Olympics (which he does). At first when I began reading about his early years, I found myself wanting to skip ahead to the part where he enters the war, but I kept reading. And I'm glad I did. The entire beginning is a perfect prelude to the years beyond his Olympic dreams. \n The story also branches off into other POWs' lives, allowing insight into multiple people, and the way it was written isn't confusing; in my edition, there are photos to help put faces to the names mentioned. \n I still can't believe how someone, how any of the Pacific POWs, could have survived what happened in the Japanese camps. Nor did I know how many men died in flight training, without ever actually going into war. Once captured, how does someone survive the physical brutality and dehumanization that these men went through? It's mind-blowing and the last hundred pages are just as hard to swallow. \n It also details Louis' life and others after the war: where they end up, who they marry, their kids, how long they live, and how the prisoners' traumatic experiences affected the rest of their lives. \n Unbroken opened my eyes and my mind to the world's history, and I learned a lot. For me, a person that normally reads young adult science fiction books, this non-fiction book is a must read. 5 stars.""",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

I was so emotionally involved that I had to skip ahead and find out what happened to Phil, and I cried when I did. What went on in the camps was horrifying and hard to read about, but it's important to do so. At the same time, it's important to embrace the spirit of forgiveness while still acknowledging how awful it really was. My grandmother tried to explain to me her fear and disgust in regards to the Japanese after WWII, and I can understand it better after reading this book (and others such as Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking). However, it's also important to try and understand that this behavior grew in part out of the culture itself: highly militaristic, with no respect for retreat or defeat or weakness. Having read the memoir of a kamikaze pilot it's obvious that the brutality displayed in the camps was also present even in the regular training of Japanese soldiers; as Hillenbrand suggests, some of the violence against POWs stemmed from the desire for low-ranking soldiers to lord it over the lower man on the totem pole. That said, I'm certainly not trying to excuse it or play it down. Many of the guards were pure sadists and psychopaths, sometimes chosen specifically for those qualities. Hillenbrand makes an effort to show that just like with anything else, there was a range of behavior, with moments of goodheartedness battling the brutality. The most important thing we can do is to look at the picture as a whole and try to understand all sides of it, in an effort to prevent this from happening again.""",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

In my defense, I've owned it for a while; I just forgot about it. Anyway: wow. What an amazing story. The story of the WWII experiences of Louie Zamperini is simply unbelievable. That one human has gone through such a journey seems unreal. A troublemaker as a kid, he went on to Olympic fame. From there, he ended up in the Pacific Front. Crashing in the pacific, adrift in the Pacific for over forty days, living off captured raw fish, rain water, all the while fending off hungry sharks: and this is just the beginning? I kept thinking: this can't possibly get worse. And then it got worse. Way worse. He ended up floating to the Japanese occupies Marshall Islands. And from there. . . \n Zamperini's story was one of the most powerful I've ever read. I would have preferred a 3.5 star review,coming not from the content, but from the delivery. Hillenbrand is not a strong story teller and I that really hurt the overall quality of the book. She was highly researched and informed. But her book came off as an extended newspaper article; full of details but lacking on humanness. This could have - should have - been much richer, the characters could have been much deeper. Now, perhaps, this isn't a fair criticism; Zamperini's story is so rich, so heavy, so unbelievable that maybe it is beyond the scope of any biographer to adequately convey. Nevertheless, I am glad I finally picked this book up, dusted it off. As of this writing, Zamperini, at 97, is still alive. That he survived at all and overcame the dark demons implanted in him by the atrocities he faced and that it is all true (!) is an amazing message.""",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in .

I've seen countless films, heard numerous songs, and read dozens of books dealing with the horrors the Allied forces faced during WWII. And it never ceases to amaze, disgust, frighten, or humble me. \n Louis Zamperini was an astonishing man, whose resiliency resonates throughout Laura Hillenbrand's exquisitely written book. To have experienced what he went through, and then to have the courage and faith to forgive and let go of his hate, is something I found myself wondering if I would ever have the strength to do. I'm in awe of this man, and of all the men captured and held prisoner in the Pacific Theatre of WWII. \n On a side note, I listened to the audio version of this book, read by Edward Herrmann and the narration is absolutely top notch.""",4.39,"In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in . Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant's name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.

Each chapter, you read about how he engages in misfortune and adventure only to see one of his friends or family members be claimed by the oppressive governmental forces or the specter those forces cast, and just when you think it's going to be Noah himself, the finger of fate touches someone close to him. \n The entire book is a loving tribute to his mother, who if even half the things were true, sounds like a model for all mothers and an outspoken work for reforming how we approach domestic abuse. He gives an unflinching eye on how far can you support someone who's willing to live in a bad relationship. \n There's also enough visceral details on what poor and starving people use for food to last a reader a very long while. \n What's definitely noticeable are the tales left behind in the margins: what happened to Teddy who went to jail for eating chocolates, how Trevor helped raise his two brothers after a harrowing event, and the challenges of becoming a comedian in South Africa and eventually the big question: how did he get out of South Africa? which is a recurring theme but unsatisfactorily never answered. The sad effect of these omissions is that it makes the book seem narcissistic at times which he readily cops to in the book, so that may be the truth. \n Overall, while I feel enriched for his story and I'm happy he's made it out of that place, I like him a little less as a person.""",4.45,"The compelling, inspiring, and comically sublime story of one man's coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.
Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.
Born a Crimeis the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.
The eighteen personal essays collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand more about life in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa. \n I only rated it three stars because I'm not comfortable with some of the timeline and authenticity of this book. I was astonished to learn, after reading, that Trevor Noah's mother converted to Judaism when he was a child. He had a Bar Mitzvah that was ill-attended. Was he unable to reconcile this part of his mother's life with the rest of his story? I want to know whether she was, indeed, still calling on the name of Jesus by the time he was 19 (at the end of the book). \n South African reviewers question whether he was really hidden away until the age of six; when anti-mixing laws were overturned when he was two years old. I can accept his version of these facts, because this was the impression he had when he was a child. I still recommend this book, with the understanding that his reality may not have been the average reality of a mixed-race child in South Africa during that time period.""",4.45,"The compelling, inspiring, and comically sublime story of one man's coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed.
Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.
Born a Crimeis the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.

Trevor Noah's unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents' indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa's tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.
Born a Crimeis the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man's relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother: his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.

McLain obviously knows how to write, but here she seems to be mimicking Hemingway's pared down style, making her narrator, Hadley, read as passive and, frankly, impotent. Hadley narrates what should be intensely emotional anecdotes--her father's suicide, the birth and life of her child, her husband's betrayals, and the breakup of her marriage--with dispassionate summary. It put up a wall between me and the character and, as a result, I skimmed through like I was reading newspaper headlines. I also got a bit tired of reading one paragraph describing how poor she and Hemingway were and how much they had to scrimp and sacrifice, and then a following paragraph describing her nanny and the extended vacations they took all over Europe. Yep. Poor people have nannies. \n There were some interesting bits, like hearing about the characters who inhabited France and the Hemingways' lives, and how Hemingway incorporated his friends into his fiction. But so much of it felt like pure conjecture (I'm thinking specifically of the italicized passages [huge passages of italics, ugh] of third-person p.o.v. from Papa Hem himself about encounters with vixens trying to seduce him away from his poor homely wife, and his early suicidal fascinations). I guess I'm not a fan of historical fiction for a reason--I'd much rather just read a solid history or biography instead of something with such pretense.""",3.79,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.
Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness--until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group--the fabled ""Lost Generation""--that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.
Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage--a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they've fought so hard for.

When Hadley Richardson meets Ernest she is a 28 year old spinster living in her sister's home. She visits a friend in Chicago shortly after her mother, who she cared for, dies from an illness. She meets 20 year old Ernest Hemingway at a party. Ernest has just returned from the war and is suffering from what we now know as PTSD. He is working as a journalist but dreams of something bigger. They have an instant connection. When Hadley returns home they continue their courtship through letters. Shortly later Hadley returns to Chicago and they are married. \n They move to Paris when Ernest decides to make of go of writing as a career. McLain describes in detail the process by which Ernest became Hemingway. His writing process and struggles to succeed are recounted through Hadley's eyes. At the same time Hadley describes her struggle to determine what it means to be a wife and later a mother without losing her identity. She loves Ernest and wants him to succeed but as success begins to come she fears the changes she begins to see. \n Many of the darlings of the literary world make an appearance including the Fitzgeralds, Stein, Pound, Dos Pasos, MacLeish and the golden couple Gerald and Sara Murphy. The behavior by some (open marriages, mistresses, children born to women other than their wives) seemed somewhat shocking. It was the Jazz Age and boozing around was expected but I was surprised by some of the details involving affairs. It was also fascinating to see Hadley struggle to fit in with their new circle of friends. Because Hadley always appeared to be an outsider it made her the perfect person to recount all the details as an outside observer. \n As their marriage begins to fall apart I couldn't help but feel for Hadley and her son, Bumby. She had given so much to Ernest when he struggled and she wasn't able to enjoy the success that came to him. But ultimately, it appears that success didn't bring Hemingway happiness as he went on to marry three more times and ultimately commit suicide. Hadley however found solace with her second husband. \n I LOVED this book. I didn't want it to end. I savored reading each page. I felt transported to the 1920s and I could picture Paris and see what drew Hadley to Ernest. McLain is an incredible writer and clearly did a lot of research to compile this book. There are many little details like music, books, drinks, etc that are woven in. \n I would highly recommend reading this book. \n Note: I received my copy from Library Thing's Early Reviewer program. Though I would have gladly paid full price for this book as it's one that I imagine I will reread many times in the future.""",3.79,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.

I fully confess that The Sun Also Rises is one of my favorite books EVER, and I\'ve been on something of a Hemingway kick of late. (Blame Woody Allen\'s Midnight in Paris, or my 2008 trip to Pamplona and San Sebastian, or the collected short story collection I gobbled up in grad school.) \n I think if you have even a touch of Hemingway fever, you feel like squealing when Hem meets up with Gertrude and Alice, Dos, Pound and Shakespear, and of course the lovably-drunk F. Scott and Zelda. The story is told from the perspective of Hemingway\'s first wife, Hadley -- surely a grounding force for the time they were together, up until the point that Hemingway decided he wanted to move on. I\'m no expert (I count Wiki as a source of Hemingway knowledge), but the book feels historically accurate and meticulously researched, so I have no qualms there. \n What I do miss, though, is the Hemingway voice. While Hadley was sitting in her sawmill apartment taking care of Bumby\'s cough, I was a little restless. I wanted to be where Hem was, in the cafes where he banged out story after story, in the thick of the salon with Gertrude instead of to the side with Alice. \n Still, I think it would be very difficult not to love a story that begins (or very nearly) with these words: ""This isn\'t a detective story -- not hardly. I don\'t want to say, Keep watch for the girl who will come along and ruin everything, but she\'s coming anyway, set on her course in a gorgeous chipmunk coat and fine shoes, her sleek brown hair bobbed so close to her well-made head she\'ll seem like a pretty otter in my kitchen. Her easy smile. Her fast smart talk -- while in the bedroom, scruffy and unshaven and laid flat out on the bed like a despot king, Ernest will read his book and care nothing for her.

Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness--until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group--the fabled ""Lost Generation""--that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.
Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging.

McLain does a great job with her characters, with her story, with her writing. I enjoyed peering into the Lost Generation in early Paris; so many familiar names before or as they made it big. And it certainly looked at how relationships can change with circumstances, in this case fame, but also the people you live with. Most married people bemoan the loss of their single friends after the wedding and again after children (or vice versa), and this is the novel of why that's not really bad. The writing is vibrating, the story intriguing, and I finished the whole book in less than 24 hours. It's an easy read. \n And yet. I couldn't drop the feeling that I wouldn't really have cared about the novel if it hadn't been centered on the Hemingways. The story is character driven, but only because they were such characters. Much of the tale was about how Hemingway struggled to make it. And Hadley - Hadley was sweet and charming and, you know, perfect. She never did anything wrong, except maybe love and need her husband too much. Sorry, I don't buy that. Just like a marriage takes two, so does its degradation - and yes, Ernest gets the cheater blame and no one makes their spouse be unfaithful...But before that, all failures were painted as his, and I don't buy that. \n Then, too, there were dichotomies. He loved her for her strength but without him she was weak. Even with him, she was passive if it was what he wanted. It's hard to see it both ways. Maybe that's how it ran, I haven't read anything else about their lives, but even in France with a hip crowd, it takes a strong woman to leave her husband and become a single mom, especially with no job skills, especially in 1927, especially when she was brought up classically and seemed so against the post-war movement. \n So unlike many of the people who reviewed the novel, I can't help but think the real Hadley must have been stronger than she was portrayed. I'm interested in learning more about her, honestly, and I'm glad she ultimately found her happily ever after. \n As for the novel, a great beach read, enjoyable.""",3.79,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.

Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group--the fabled ""Lost Generation""--that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F.

Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging.

They met in Chicago before either of them even thought of living in Paris so their marriage was built initially on the foundation of troubled upbringings that were stifling and provided them with the impetus to move, somewhere, anywhere, as long as it was far away from their families. \n Hadley is older than Ernest by seven years, already a spinster looking after her infirm mother and bearing the brunt of censorious remarks from her sister as well as a jealous friend and former wannabe lover of Ernest. Hadley represents rock-like strength and stability for the restless Hemingway. She also suppresses any career goals she might have to be his helpmate in support of his flourishing writing career. \n When they encounter the culturati of Paris, where monogamy and fidelity are relics of an old world, Hadley tries to be open and receptive to these new customs and standards. The sophisticated literary set sees their marriage as stable and sweetly quaint in this environment of avant-garde art, fashion and lifestyle. Ernest gets a taste of these other cultural delicacies--inexpensive and abundant alcohol, stimulating conversations and theories on art, beautiful, aggressive women--and wants to sample everything on the buffet. An inevitable rift develops between them. The support she had provided for him is compromised when she becomes pregnant with their son and betrayed when manifested later by the theft on a train of a valise containing all of his work to date, a loss which Hemingway attributes to her carelessness and lack of enthusiasm for his career and for which he never forgives her. \n The novel is told through Hadley's point of view, with italicized mini-chapters providing Hemingway's point of view. As I read these, however, I wondered if these were supposed to be taken at face value as what Hemingway really thought or if these were his perspectives as Hadley imagined they might be retrospectively, as she is recalling her own experience of the marriage. The novel effectively presents an intelligent woman of the time who is divided between wanting to evolve and become more free-thinking and clinging to the ideas of marriage she has inherited from her background. It also presents a perspective on Hemingway as a young, conflicted, ambitious man who sincerely loves Hadley and wants an enduring marriage and yet the parts of himself that are 'good and straight and fine and true' as he said of Hadley, are chipped away by the world he wants to join and the steps he feels he is required to take in order to achieve his ambitions. As much as Hadley would like to be the long-suffering wife who tolerates the weaknesses of her husband, ultimately she decides to give him up and set them both free. While she does achieve a hard-won freedom with a successful second marriage, unfortunately Ernest does not, making three more attempts at marriage and realizing at the end of his life that he lost something beautiful (both his first spouse and his former self) that he could never regain. \n Often the prose takes on Hemingwayesque rhythms as his influence either subsumes Hadley's identity or infiltrates the prose of Paula McClain or both. Not having read Hadley's letters I can't say whether this effect ever made itself known through her written expression. In a sense, this novel is as much of a literary tribute to Hemingway as a fictional way of delving into the minds and emotions of Hadley and Ernest so I suppose it could be seen as stylistically appropriate. \n While the novel is convincing in its depiction of the famous figures of the time, all seen through Hadley's point of view--Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, etc.--and it successfully depicts the arc of a marriage, from the blissful beginnings to the bitter and heartbreaking end, it is essentially another literary curiosity that, while it is certainly readable and provides insights into marriage and this marriage in particular and the period in which it occurred, it too, like a 'Paris wife' is an accessory to a great writer, basking in the reflected light of its sun.""",3.79,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.

The author obviously based the story on facts and real correspondence, but chose to embellish the narrative by writing in first person as Hadley. I\'m not sure I understood the point of doing so. Author McLain offers little introspection into Hadley\'s thoughts or feelings, and Hadley comes across as one-dimensional. Even as a secondary character, Hemingway himself pulls more of the focus of the novel. Hadley seemed like an afterthought, like a companion to Hemingway\'s strong personality. Maybe she thought of herself that way. \n I found the descriptions of an artist\'s life in 1920s Paris fascinating: philosophical conversations in smoky cafes, spontaneous trips to Spain for inspiration, and a constant fog from too much alcohol. I enjoyed reading personal accounts (albeit somewhat fictionalized) with Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. They were idealistic artists, celebrities of their time, and they were as provocative as any ""Brangelina"" celebrities of today. \n But the setting can only carry a book so far. As mentioned, I couldn\'t empathize with Hadley because McLain didn\'t bring her to life. There\'s not much plot movement, other than watching Hemingway become an author and their marriage become dissolved. Hemingway behaves questionably, but I struggled more with why Hadley allows him to continue. \n I don\'t regret reading The Paris Wife, and there are some redeeming qualities, but overall I didn\'t find it very affecting.'",3.79,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.

Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happiness--until she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever.

Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises.

After all, Hadley was quiet and unfashionable, and his elder by 7 years. Hem was charismatic, had earned a medal in the big war, and intensely ambitious, having already decided he\'d soon become a great novelist. Not quite a match made in heaven. Nevertheless, they marry and settle in Paris, where all the up and comers, writers and artists, hang out. Hem writes, she cooks, and the gradually become friends with the literati, such luminaries as Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, John Dos Passos, and Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. They travel a lot with their new friends, spending months at a time in Switzerland and Spain, where Hem collects material for his books. And drinks. A lot. Hadley keeps up with him, but is decidedly uncomfortable being merely ""the wife"" among these people, but the first chink in the marriage comes about after a suitcase is stolen on her train, its contents nothing less than Hem\'s life\'s work so far. She\'s devastated, he\'s devastated, but he does his best to forgive her. From this point forward, we glimpse their destruction as a couple. When Hadley (inadvertently ?) becomes pregnant, Hem is dismayed. After all, it\'s impossible to live the bohemian life with an infant in tow. But he does his best to try. It was probably inevitable that poor, dull, but very strong Hadley would be left behind, it\'s awfully hard for the reader to forgive the narcissistic man who always had to have it his way, no matter what ""it"" was. Hemingway would live to marry three other women. In the epilogue, Hadley, who\'s moved on with her life, described him as an ""enigma - fine and strong and weak and cruel. An incomparable friend and a SOB [my abbreviation]"". \n Paula McClain\'s fictionalized memoir is addictive and compelling, told by Hadley herself. She relied heavily upon Hemingway\'s posthumous memoir of his life in Paris, A Moveable Feast, a book I read long ago. The Paris Wife has inspired me to read his version of what happened so long ago in Paris.'",3.79,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.

Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage--a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they've fought so hard for.

You bring your own life experiences and past relationships to the table and use them as a lens through which you can make each poem/piece have meaning for you. If you bring emotionally rich history with you to the table and then open yourself up to tap back into it via the text and imagery presented in the book, I imagine you can have a rich experience reading this book indeed. But if you\'re not willing to try to make that connection between the material and your own life, you will probably be closed off from the beauty of this book. \n Or, if you\'ve never loved, or been loved, or had your heart broken, or broke someone\'s heart, or longed for someone who was out of your reach, I imagine reading this book would be a different experience altogether. I guess you would have to read it and construct the character of ""you"" in your mind. Which might be enjoyable as well - conjecturing on what happened between the ""I""/author and the ""you"" that the author addresses. \n This rest of this review is spoilery and not necessary to read. Just know that you might like this book and you might not. It just depends if you are willing to open yourself up to the emotions it elicits. \n 11/12/14 \n Woke up and read some more and in the cold light of a new day felt a bit more cynical about it. Some of the sentiments reminded me of past fixations that were not so healthy. Being reminded of times when I thought love meant being wholly consumed by another person and letting the sun rise and set by their acceptance or rejection. I\'m in a different headspace of what I want out of a relationship, so perhaps it\'s harder for me to indulge in the ""give it all up for love"" mentality. \n It\'s a little too much to read all at once so I shall read a bit at a time. \n 11/13/14 \n These could be a collection of greeting card innards, but like an artful, sensitive, romantic, non-cheesy, but truly vulnerable-making heartfelt greeting card company. These are confessional notes anyone would dream of receiving. They\'re love letters made public. \n This is making me feel crazy nostalgic for when I was in young love. \n Several of these would make stellar wedding toasts. \n Geez, each page packs an emotional punch or requires reflection. I like to read only a couple pages at a time so I can take a few moments to absorb. \n But if I read too many pages in a row I start losing the emotional punch and it starts feeling like piled on or less genuine and they start just becoming good lines, intended to manipulate the reader. \n I forgot how much I love love. \n It\'s hard to jump into these intensely personal and vulnerable declarations without any context or development of characters. You have to just give it the benefit of the doubt that these are genuine sentiments and engage with the possibility of it. As a reader, it\'s an experiment and you get out of it what you will. \n ""The DIaries of Foreign Lovers \n You are so patriotic to your heart. It keeps the country together. \n But it tears the world apart."" \n Gah! it jumps from totally devastating, tapping into that feeling of lost love, to the next page, totally heart-happy young love with romantic exuberance, to heart-stoppingly romantic talk that elicits a ""get-in-my-bed-nao"" response. \n I like the fluidity of the ""you."" These statements seem directed at many different people in many different contexts, and goes to prove how personal and universal our experiences are. \n It\'s like those \'stories told in 6 words\' meme. There are whole worlds and stories behind these few lines. \n ""The Forgotten Star \n You keep telling me to be glad for what we had while we had it. That the brightest flame burns quickest. \n Which means you saw us as a candle. And I saw us as the sun."" \n Ok, we are no longer jumping through the spectrum of love, we seem to have shifted to a new phase of breakup torment. My heart! \n Now I\'m plowing through because I don\'t want to sit with this looking back on love. It hits too close to home and no reflection is necessary. Resolution, moving on, how to get through it, however, are sentiments I wouldn\'t mind being illuminated. \n Wow, this is rough. Might need to step away for a bit. \n ""The City Rises and Falls \n You were a dream. Then a reality. Now a memory."" \n Ah, the ""you"" is shifting. I love how gradual this is. I\'m loving this new phase. I hope the author would forgive me using his/her poetry as self-help. \n I love how it evolves from writing for someone else to writing for oneself. \n ""The Finite Curve \n You will only be hurt a finite number of times during your life. \n You have an infinite number of ways to deal with it."" \n I think I need to read the third from the last (""The Day You Read This"") every morning when I wake up :) \n What a ride! I feel really good coming out of it and enriched by the experience of reading this book.'",4.16,"I need you to understand something. I wrote this for you. I wrote this for you and only you.

He\'s an old man on a factory line. You wouldn\'t recognise him. \n Gandhi was born to a wealthy stockbroker in New York. He never forgave the world after his father threw himself from his office window, on the 21st floor. \n And everyone, somewhere, is someone, if we only give them a chance. \n THE GHOST TRAIN \n And if you can\'t say yes, answer anyway. Because I\'d rather live with the answer than die with the question. \n THE CORNER OF ME AND YOU \n I don\'t know if you felt that or not. \n But it felt like two people kissing after hours of thinking about it. \n It felt like two people talking after nights of silence. \n It felt like two people touching after weeks of being numb. \n It felt like two people facing each other after months of looking away. \n It felt like two people in love after years of being alone. \n And it felt like two people meeting each other, after an entire lifetime of not meeting each other. \n THE FIRST TIME WE MET \n It\'s when you hold eye contact for that second too long or maybe the way you laugh. It sets off a flash and our memories take a picture of who we are at that point when we first know ""This is love."" \n And we clutch that picture to our hearts because we expect each other to always be the people in that picture. But people change. People aren\'t pictures. And you can either take a new picture or throw the old one away. \n THE FORGOTTEN STAR \n You keep telling me to be glad for what we had while we had it. That the brightest flame burns quickest. \n Which means you saw us as a candle. And I saw us as the sun. \n THE BRIDGE FROM SOLITUDE \n Just like you mistook lust for love, you have mistaken being alone with loneliness. So I\'m fine. Thank you for asking. \n THE CUPBOARD IS EMPTY \n I\'m all out of midnight phone calls and flowers sent to your door. I\'m out of throwing letters off fire escapes and drawing a cathedral in the sand. I\'m out of spray-painting your name on freeway overpasses. I\'m low on cute names given between blankets and 9 am. I\'ve got no dramatic displays of public affection left. And now everyone else I ever love is going to think me boring. Because I used it all up on you. \n THE SEA RECLAIMS THE LAND \n I know you\'re just a rag doll now, sewn together with memories that we might have had. \n I know you\'re just the dream inside of a dream \n And don\'t worry, I know I don\'t know you, anymore. \n THE WOOD IN TREES \n You constantly look for a sign and when it\'s given to you and you don\'t like the answer, you call it a coincidence. There are no coincidences. \n THE AUDIENCE OF ONE \n You\'re too pretty to be weird and too weird to be pretty. \n And you feel strange when people try to talk to you. So get a job, it\'s safer than art. Maybe people won\'t point and stare so much. Even if they\'re only in your head. Especially if they\'re only in your head. \n ""Love, at every opportunity you are given to love. Be less afraid. Embrace each day (none are promised). Cry when you need to, it\'ll make you feel better. You were put on this planet to feel every feeling you could, do that. Everything works out in the end. \n I promise.""'",4.16,"I need you to understand something. I wrote this for you. I wrote this for you and only you. Everyone else who reads it, doesn't get it.

Then when their body leaves, they won't. \n This book is divided into 4 chapters; Sun, Moon, Stars, and Rain. \n I can't choose which chapter is the best. Because each poem inside those chapters gave me goosebumps, made me look back in the past years of my life and moved my heart in such a equisite way. I don't really feel the vibe that it was written for me, (like what the author said in the intro) but I admit, most poems in this book speak for my life and echo my thoughts. Which is why I like this book. I think this poetry book is for everyone because the poems here reflect different situations of different types of people. \n Now I will quote two poems which really caught my eye and moved my heart. \n The Trees That Decided Not To Die \n As I put down my pen, I know someone, somewhere is picking up theirs.I know that someone, somewhere is playing a guitar for the first time.I know that someone, somewhere is dipping a paintbrush and marking a field of white.I know that someone, somewhere is singing a song that's never been sung. Perhaps someone, somewhere will create something so beautiful and moving, it will change the world. Perhaps that somewhere is here. Perhaps that someone is you. \n The Day You Read This \n On this day, you read something that moved you and made you realise there were no more fears to fear. No tears to cry. No head to hang in shame. That every time you thought you'd offended someone, it was all just in your head and really, they love you with all their heart and nothing will ever change that. That everyone and everything lives on inside you. That that doesn't make any of it any less real.That soft touches will change you and stay with you longer than hard ones.That being alone means you're free. That old lovers miss you and new lovers want you and the one you're with is the one you're meant to be with. That the tingles running down your arms are angel feathers and they whisper in your ear, constantly, if you choose to hear them. That everything you want to happen, will happen, if you decide you want it enough. That every time you think a sad thought, you can think a happy one instead.That you control that completely.That the people who make you laugh are more beautiful than beautiful people. That you laugh more than you cry. That crying is good for you. That the people you hate wish you would stop and you do too.That your friends are reflections of the best parts of you. That you are more than the sum total of the things you know and how you react to them. That dancing is sometimes more important than listening to the music.That the most embarrassing, awkward moments of your life are only remembered by you and no one else. That no one judges you when you walk inreally want to know, is if you're judging them. That what you make and what you do with your time is more important than you'll ever fathom and should be treated as such. That the difference between a job and art is passion. That neither defines who you are. That talking to strangers is how you make friends.That bad days end but a smile can go around the world. That life contradicts itself, constantly. That that's why it's worth living.That the difference between pain and love is time. That love is only as real as you want it to be. That if you feel good, you look good but it doesn't always work the other way around.That the sun will rise each day and it's up to you each day if you match it. That nothing matters up until this point. That what you decide now, in this moment, will change the future. Forever. That rain is beautiful. And so are you.""",4.16,"I need you to understand something. I wrote this for you. I wrote this for you and only you. Everyone else who reads it, doesn't get it.

I know this isn\'t the case but I can\'t help but feel these poems are so personal. I guess that\'s the real magic. I\'m fully aware that Iain S. Thomas, the author, may have intentionally written the book this way in order to market towards a larger audience but the author still managed to connect with me and make me feel that I could relate to things I\'ve never experienced. \n Writing style: \n I tend to enjoy some rhyme and traditional verse but the short sentences didn\'t bother me at all. There was a clear purpose behind the length of sentences, they were fully formed sentences, and line breaks were used appropriately (*cough* Milk and Honey *cough*). \n The Seat Next To You - ""When I sit near you, my hands suddenly become alien things and I don\'t know where to put them or what they usually do, like this is the first time I\'ve ever had hands and maybe they go in my pockets and maybe they don\'t."" \n The Floor Takes So Long To Hit - ""Congratulations. You took me down. And now, you have made everything that is sad, relevant."" \n Anthology format: \n I loved the photographs with the poems. I could form a connection between the pictures and each poem, although of course that connection is left up to interpretation. \n The book of poems is comprised of four parts: Sun, Moon, Stars, and Rain. I couldn\'t figure out the connection between the poems and the name of each section. Although maybe they have some kind of metaphorical connection I didn\'t catch onto? Each section had a good selection of poems, but my favorite section of poems was definitely Stars. I was literally bookmarking nearly every poem in that section. \n A few of my other favorite poems were: \n The Moths Don\'t Die For Nothing - ""I\'m sure people just kiss each other. I\'m sure that sometimes you\'re talking and somehow two people move closer and closer to each other and then, they just kiss. I\'m sure it happens all the time. But I\'m also sure that a kiss is never just a kiss."" \n The Heart Beats Per Minute ""You are the best parts of all the songs I love.""'",4.16,"I need you to understand something.

This type of book turns my attempts to track my reading into a total mess. First of all, how can I rate someone\'s life experience? Yes, this was an amazing read.

Whenever I decide to rate non-fiction books about painful subjects or lives, it feels wrong. \n The second problem I have is that I don\'t know what to do with the information I have gained from Rankine. I think I am being uncivil by not doing something. I am, whether I like it or not, part of the problem. However, often my best intentions are not helpful. \n So the best I can do is say that everyone should learn more about racism and be more aware of the ways people and our country are shortchanged by not treating everyone as equals. \n In this masterful book, Rankine combines essays, poems and art to tell her readers about the experience of being black now in our country. She tells hard stories and works hard to make us see our world through others\' eyes. I think she is extraordinarily successful at this - and so the book is hard to read. \n I will be looking for other books by Claudine Rankine.

It\'s documents the weight of excusing racists slights and ignoring views in attempts to just exist as human.The book navigates between short poems and powerful vignettes. One of the most memorable being the disconcerting feeling and shame that happens when your friend says something to you that is racist, and it markedly changes how you feel about that person, no matter how many times they explain it\'s a joke. \n ""...a friend once told you there exists the medical term- John Henryism- for people exposed to stresses stemming from racism. They achieve themselves to death trying to dodge the buildup of erasure."" \n The resounding truth I read in these poems, and the sigh of relief I felt reading came because I try very hard to look past small acts of racism. But it felt great to read that it\'s not normal to play by rules that have addendum\'s just for you, and meekly never complain. Claudia Rankin explains the racism that Serena Williams has experienced and how it is often overlooked even as she completely dominates her sport. Yesterday a sport\'s commentator in reference to Venus Williams said ""You see Venus move in and put the gorilla effect on. Charging."" This illustrates how black athletes often deal with racism, and cast it aside as apart of the game, but that cost paid is never acknowledged. \n ""because white men can\'t \n police their imagination \n black people are dying"" \n This poetry collection includes mixed media. It highlights pictures, art installations and even refers to YouTube videos. I enjoyed it because the inclusion of modern illustrations and references made it a contemporary reflection for us all. The book also describes situations, which are videos produced on her website. I won\'t review the videos but I found context for what was described with out them.

I wish that someone had written a British equivalent. Perhaps they have. \n There is a danger that you/one will read this book and think I\'m not black it\'s not relevant to me - that\'s missing the point. There is a danger that people reading this book will think things are so much worse in America - that is missing the point. There is a danger that when reading it you might think that\'s terrible but I am not racist - that too is missing the point. \n This book is not poetry and it\'s not an essay. This book both poetry and an essay. There are moments in it of pure gloriousness of language. There were moments of pure gloriousness of language that also made me want to weep, that made me uncomfortable in my mind and skin - that\'s the point. Some of the pictures were too small with lots of white space around them, I sometimes struggled to see them properly - that is the point. This book will make you remember your own moments of action/inaction - that is the point. You might think \'but some of my friends are black"" the fact that you are even thinking like that is the point. \n Two of my childhood best friends were black. One of them was allowed to do football (rare for a girl in those days) when I wasn\'t because ""black kids are better at sport."" I lost touch with those friends - black kids went to the secondary school, I went to the grammar school. One of them grew up and killed herself and her children. The paper said she was ""deeply troubled."" Why was she deeply troubled? That is the point. \n I do not love this book. I hate this book. I love the way it uses language, the repetition of words and phrases, the hardness of the sound of the violent language. I love the way the pictures use the white space around them and become visual poems. I love this book and hate it.

From the first section she has many examples of the daily microaggressions or racism, and how they affect the body with trauma. She writes, ""Certain moments send adrenaline to the heart, dry out the tongue, and clog the lungs. Like thunder they drown you in sound no, like lightening they strike you across the larynx. Cough."" \n And, ""As usual you drive straight through the moment with the expected backing off of what was previously said. It is not only that the confrontation is headache-producing; it is also that you have a destination that doesn\'t include acting like this moment isn\'t inhabitable,"" \n And, ""...want time to function as a power wash. Sitting there staring at the closed garage door you are reminded that a friend once told you there exists the medical term--John Henryism--for people exposed to stresses stemming from racism. They achieve themselves to death trying to dodge the buildup of erasure."" \n This honest book lays out what it is like to live under racism, which means having the symptoms of post traumatic stress. \n In section 2 she braids the approach of, ""Hennessy Youngman aka Jayson Musson, whose Art Thoughtz take the form of tutorials on YouTube, educates viewers on contemporary art issues. In one of his many videos, he addresses how to become a successful black artist, wryly advises blacke artists to cultivate ""an angry nigger exterior"" by watching, among other things, the Rodney King video while working."" She terms this ""commodified anger"" and points out, ""...it is tied solely to the performance of blackness and not to the emotional state of particular individuals in particular situations."" She braids this with a look at the history of Serena Williams and uses a quote from Zora Neale Hurston, ""I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background."" She goes on, ""This appropriated line, stenciled on canvas by Glenn Ligon, who used plastic letter stencils, smudging oil sticks, and graphite to transform the words into abstractions, seemed to be ad copy for some aspect of life for all blacks."" \n It is a beautiful book with art throughout. It won the National Book Award. It is time for a revolution and change, this book adds to what needs to be said, what needs to be known, and I hope many will read this stellar book.

I\'ve read many reviews about the poetry here, but it\'s particularly hard for me to appreciate poetry when I\'m not seeing it on the page. That said, I did find the book to be well-composed, utilizing a unique voice to bring up the small scale and large scale racial aggressions seen and experienced in day to day life, both personally and from the media. \n Entertainment Value \n This one flew by - only a little bit over two hours on audio - so I\'m assuming that it would also be a quick read in print. It really packs a punch though. I think it\'s so important right now for people of all races to be listening to each other\'s stories. You can hear a lecture on racism or read an article about it, but what\'s really going to make a difference in the way you see the world is hearing a person\'s story - how they feel when certain phrases are used, how media reactions affect their day to day lives, etc. This book completely fit that bill for me. It gave me a glimpse into the casual racism that, being white and privileged, I\'d most likely never pick up on. \n Narration \n The narrator does a great job, but I found myself getting lost a few times, particularly during portions that are more poetic in format. I think I would have enjoyed this more if I read it in print and will be making an effort to find a print copy. \n Overall \n I don\'t think anyone of any political persuasion would deny that the last year has been a difficult one for our country in terms of race relations. And as I mentioned above, I think the key to combating racism (or gender inequality or sexual orientation or religious differences or any other) is to sit down and listen to what a person on the other side has to say about their own experiences. Hearing ""this hurts me because"" or ""this makes me furious because"" from another human being will always make more of an impact than hearing a list of arbitrary reasons. I think that Rankine does an excellent job here of using various forms of literature, from essay to poetry, to convey her personal story. I highly recommend this book to everyone - it\'s so important to do the hard work and think the hard thoughts that will help us make a difference in the ways we relate to each other.'",4.3,"A provocative meditation on race, Claudia Rankine's long-awaited follow up to her groundbreaking book Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric.

Citizen is an investigation into the ways of dealing with that. Do you snap? Do you let out the rage that's accumulated over the years, that submerged part of the iceberg, risk appearing insane, unreasonable, unprofessional? Do you move past it, ignore it, pretend it's not there, don't make a big deal of it? Rise above it! It's an exception, a slip-up. But aren't our days just made up of a long string of exceptions? You lose either way. You try to not have it accumulate inside, but it does. \n Here are some high profile cases. Serena Williams. Trayvon Martin. James Craig Anderson. Here are some personal unsung silent moments--just swallow it down. How many more moments have been swallowed without notice? Without even the sound of a gulp? \n Sitting at the coffeeshop, the guy on the phone swaggers back and forth in front of me talking loudly about some property. To be that guy, to be so oblivious and so carefree inside your body, your white skin. Have I ever? \n Am I invisible to him? What is it you don't see? How much of the world is invisible to you? \n How much is invisible to me? \n From Claudia Rankine's perspective, the world from inside of her black body and her black experiences... this is not a book for white people. Although white people will read it, and should. \n You will either recognize it instantly. Echoes of your own moments. Or you'll be confronted with this other world, previously invisible, in which you do not participate and have never experienced. It's okay. You can ignore it and move on. Or you can acknowledge it and maybe some of it will sink in enough for you to see it the next time, maybe only the outlines. It will still require vigilant effort. Always and that's ok. \n Because we don't like talking about it. We certainly don't, as much as it may seem like we do.

Given the fact that Rankine\'s interest is life as an African-American woman, and the racism with all the ordinary, sometimes daily insults, condescension, unthought disrespect, half-noticed slurs, and other painful experiences, it does not often make sense that most of her illustrations are by successful artists. There is very little reference to the artists in the text, which I think has to lead to the conclusion that she thinks their work is the best illustration of her concerns. But is it? Carrie Mae Weems, Nick Cave, or Glenn Ligon often have very different agendas and interests, and their work raises specific issues that are not mentioned in the text -- and the reason for their absence is itself not articulated \n For me, the only way to read the illustrations in ""Citizen"" as apposite to the text is to think of them generically, as art, and not to notice, or to forget, their different careers, symbolism, and narratives. A few pictures are from the media, like the one of Caroline Wozniacki pretending to be Serena Williams (p. 36), or Hennessy Youngman (p. 23). Those fit the narrative perfectly. \n I wonder if a more careful selection of images, and more passages in the text meditating on the images and their meanings, might not have raised the stakes for the narrative itself, by adding a level of reflection about what visual materials best give voice to the texts\' concerns.'",4.3,"A provocative meditation on race, Claudia Rankine's long-awaited follow up to her groundbreaking book Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric.

I began to pick this up from where I left off, recalling that the last essay/poem I had read was really long and rough to get through, but I told myself that a fresh start would be my motivation to see this with fresh eyes. And i\'m so happy I did. \n This book is gorgeous. It\'s half educational, half eye-opening. I was devastated reading this, and constantly impressed with the quality of the writing, the one-liners, and the depth of emotion to this. The first time I read this, I must not have been in the right state of mind, because this punched me in the gut the second time. I loved almost every single page, and the art and photography interspersed just made it that much more tragic. \n My only complaint is that sometimes Rankine\'s writing gravitates toward being overly wordy. Several pieces exclude punctuation, which is a stylistic choice many may enjoy, but I\'m not a fan and find myself unable to follow easily. Additionally, many longer pieces can lose me in the wordy explanations and long sentences, so I found myself preferring her shorter pieces, even though all presented well-thought out and poignant ideas. \n This must be required reading.

I thought I would have gotten through it faster because it was written in verse but alas that was not the case. \n I picked this book up for two reasons. The first was to try to read a type of book outside of my comfort zone ( adult non fiction, poetry/ verse, mix media literature etc) and the second was to read something pertaining to being black in America. I\'m black but not American and I wanted to read something acclaimed that talked about the experience over there because though it not perfect here, it\'s no where near the crazy over there. \n I did not rate this book because I don\'t think I am qualified to rate this type of book. I can have an opinion but I can\'t rate the way it was written because I have never read any poetry before and frankly I didn\'t like it. I don\'t like the way the prose is constructed. Sentences I can\'t even read in a familiar rhythm because , even though they are written in simple English, they don\'t make sense when read all together. \n Ex. If they he she we you were to concluded yesterday to know whatever was done could also be done, was also done, was never done - \n How about whole sections of prose with little to no punctuation which is my biggest pet peeve of life \n Ex.

I can\'t connect fully. I wish I could have a better understanding of it but most of the time it just seems like a bunch of random words stuck together and in it I\'m suppose to find some type of enlightenment.

Rankine\'s small book of essays tells us the myriad ways we consistently misinterpret others\' motives, actions, language. She writes in second person: ""you."" It is agonizing to display our flayed skin to the salt of another day. You take to wearing sunglasses inside. \n I call these essays while Holly Bass in the NYTimes calls them poems. They are fragments, scripts or screenplays for video or film, shards of thought, sharp and able to pierce one with remembered pain. Bass\'s review (12.24.14) explains the floating and disembodied hoodie on the cover, black against a field of white: an art installation made in 1993 by David Hammons, long before Trayvon Martin died--before he was even born. Rankine shares a line attributed to Zora Neale Hurston: ""I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background."" \n Rankine talks of tennis, of Serena and Venus, of foot faults and bad calls. I didn\'t know these things: I don\'t watch tennis. But foot faults and bad calls are happening on our streets, not within the civilized constraints of a rule-bound tennis game. These I do watch. The agony of the small daily slights crescendo, collapse, avalanche when the police become involved. No wonder people run away from police, our \'guardians\'. We have all learned something these many years and it is not that police are guardians. \n Overhead in the conference room: ""being around black people is like watching a foreign film without translation."" Yes, it is a cultural difference. They got that right. But that\'s all: Nothing more sinister or insoluble. And since we know that America is all about cultural differences, this should be something to celebrate. Or profit from. \n My mind slides to Obama, and how I don\'t think of him as black anymore. Have whites co-opted him? Or is it because black and white are not as different as we were expecting? That our differences really are only skin deep. I worry that we expected Obama to ""fix the race problem."" How can he fix the thousand interactions we have every day between us? By denying any differences? Have we learned nothing, nor made any progress at all? Our divisions may have been exacerbated. Tell me it ain\'t so. \n Rankine\'s essays reference the language of video, of film. My mind skims her short paragraphs and the indignities, the small and the large slights blossom. Together we imagine film, great films, films everyone watches and re-watches, praising the actorly restraint and real-life quality of the slurs...something European in slowness and length...that shows us, white and black and yellow and red...what we say, what we think, what we do...to each other. Catching those moments of misinterpretation, or interpretation, waking up to ourselves--this is what great film does. \n There is so much work to be done, art to make, change to happen! The urgency weighs on me. ""The purpose of art is to lay bare the questions hidden by the answers"": James Baldwin and Fyodor Dostoyevsky agree on definition. The ingredients of art are all around us, fat and ripe and ready to be harvested. There is so much art to be made, so many lessons to learn.

Inspired by my postcolonial theory class and discussions of race in America, I started to look for books that would give me a chance to put into use what I learned during that course, and came across Claudia Rankine\'s Citizen. My local library surprisingly had this in their collection, of which I am extremely happy, because I don\'t think an e-copy of this would have done justice to the way this book is not only written, but also put together through inclusion of images etc. \n I am a white, middle class, educated young woman from Finland. I grew up in a place where like 99.9 % of people were white and middle class, and never really had to think about issues related to race while growing up. I was 11 when I first traveled abroad, but it was to one of those places where most of the people were tourists who looked exactly like me. It wasn\'t until my exchange student year to United States at the age of 16 that I really became conscious of the issues related to race and racism. I traveled from Finland to Washington D.C. and was picked up by a family of Mexican immigrants - a wonderful group of people who offered me their home for 10 months and very quickly became like a family to me. The cultural differences were embraced at the home setting, but when I went to school and started to spend time with the family outside the home-setting, questions started to arise. Very quickly, I came face to face with situations in which I was seen as the superior due to my skin color. I was shocked - I was a quest in that country, but still some people seemed to treat me like I had more of a right to be in there than the people who had taken me in. I am grateful for my year in US, because it opened my eyes up for so many things I probably would not have become aware of in Finland, at least not at that age. Now, questions of race are becoming more and more in-bedded into our national discussions, and the perspectives I learned in US have really helped me to form my opinions about the issues in Finland right now. \n Rankine\'s collection focuses on different kind of racial encounters and aggressions in media as well as in daily life; the slips of the tongue, the questions of ""is that racist"", the representations of athletes, etc. It also pays quite extensively attention to race and issues of safety and for those who have been following the evolution of the Black Lives Matter movement, there\'s definitely a lot of food for thought here. \n This book really made me think about my own privilege, and the privilege of people around me. The way Rankine delves into the matter of everyday racism, the little slips of tongue that some people do without realizing that what they are saying might be hurtful, is done very powerfully and in a way that makes you think about your own actions and own words. Though this book is very much tied to US context, I think the message of it is universal. And since what happens in US is often felt around the world in other countries, understanding of the US society is crucial. This book can help you with that, by offering a very interesting, vivid image of racism in our contemporary, ""post-race"" society. \n If you get a chance to pick this one up, I highly recommend you do so!'",4.3,"A provocative meditation on race, Claudia Rankine's long-awaited follow up to her groundbreaking book Don't Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric.

You will have to read Man of My Dreams to find out. There are no bad people in this book! Mia, Declan and Noah are all good, loving characters who find themselves a little weighed down by the ordinary problems of life.

But the man in her dreams is the one that got away--her high school crush.
Mia's stuck in a rut, just like every other stay-at-home mom, and the only thing saving her from her monotonous routine is her perfect husband, Declan. He's gorgeous, he adores her, and the man stole her heart with his sexy singing voice. Mia feels like the luckiest girl in the world, until she discovers that Mr. Perfect is not Mr. Faithful. Mia is devastated. Everything she once believed about Declan and their marriage is now covered in a big cloud of doubt and regret. On impulse, she kicks the cheating bastard out, pushing them into a separation that could mean the end of the picture-perfect couple.
But when Mia receives an invitation to her high school reunion, she finds herself abandoning the present for the oh-so alluring pull of the past. Although her heart still belongs to her husband, inescapable thoughts of her crush, Noah, resurface. And ten years later, Noah isn't afraid to make his move. When the build-up of fantasies and 'what ifs' comes to a head, sparks fly and it's Mia's turn to question if her marriage is everything she wants out of life. Searching for answers, Mia dives head first into dating Noah, falling further away from her husband and closer to her old flame.
But Declan's not giving up so easily.

It is not often that you read a debut novel that is as well edited as this one. That scores bonus points with me. I tend to be a stickler for editing. Any way enough of that. \n Mia has been in love with Noah since the day she set eyes on him freshman year of high school. She has hoped that some way, some how they would become a couple. Mia\'s best friend Grace, tries to tell her to just give up on up on Noah and move on. But she continues to pine away for him. By Senior year, they have had a few classes together but nothing more ever developed. Realizing that they will be nothing more than acquaintances, Mia heads off to college. \n Declan has just started college and has set his sights on Mia. Only having had one real serious relationship in high school he is hesitant to approach Mia. But he feels this unbelievable pull towards her. And after a month of careful consideration he makes his move. After dating for a few years,they find themselves married and with their first child on the way. Mia is teaching and Declan has accepted a position with an accounting firm. \n What seems to be the perfect marriage on the surface, is not the case. Declan is spending longer hours at work and is now required to travel more often. When he is caught in a lie, Mia\'s trust in him is tested. And when she can no longer accept his apologies for a mistake he makes while at work, she throws him out. \n When the opportunity arises for Mia to attend her 10 year high school reunion she jumps at it. She realizes that she may get to see Noah again and maybe, just maybe she can see if it will lead anywhere. \n I love the depth of the characters. How Faith writes such a believable story. Stuff like this happens in everyday life. I for one can say that those first few years of marriage are awesome and then kids come into the picture and we are now trying to juggle how to be a mom and a wife. And somehow the wife gets lost in all of that. Patience is tested, loved ones who should be our top priority no longer are and we slowly fall apart. Being a stay at home mom is what Mia wants. She loves her children with all her heart. But at the end of the day she is exhausted and just wants to call it a night. Without realizing it she is pushing Declan away and the only way he knows to deal with it is to bury himself in his work. \n Declan loves Mia and his girls more than life itself. But he does not know how to communicate with her anymore. He has felt them pulling apart for sometime, but does not realize that he is equally responsible for the issues that lie between them. When he makes that one mistake that sends their marriage into chaos, he doesn\'t know how to fix it. Begging to come home and professing his undying love to Mia does not do the trick. When his mistake send Mia into the arms of another man, Declan realizes that he needs to step up his game if he is going to win the love of his life back. \n ""I miss you, Mia. Please let me come home. I will never stop fighting for us. I love you!"" \n This story is a roller coaster ride of emotions. I wanted to scream, cry, jump for joy, pout and beat them all up at some point. The only reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because I felt that the ending was rushed. Declan makes one last ditch effort to win Mia back and I felt that it all happened way to fast. Other than that I really enjoyed this story. Go and one click it today, you will not be disappointed!'",3.76,"Mia Murphy may be married to the man of her dreams. But the man in her dreams is the one that got away--her high school crush.
Mia's stuck in a rut, just like every other stay-at-home mom, and the only thing saving her from her monotonous routine is her perfect husband, Declan. He's gorgeous, he adores her, and the man stole her heart with his sexy singing voice. Mia feels like the luckiest girl in the world, until she discovers that Mr. Perfect is not Mr. Faithful. Mia is devastated. Everything she once believed about Declan and their marriage is now covered in a big cloud of doubt and regret. On impulse, she kicks the cheating bastard out, pushing them into a separation that could mean the end of the picture-perfect couple.
But when Mia receives an invitation to her high school reunion, she finds herself abandoning the present for the oh-so alluring pull of the past. Although her heart still belongs to her husband, inescapable thoughts of her crush, Noah, resurface. And ten years later, Noah isn't afraid to make his move. When the build-up of fantasies and 'what ifs' comes to a head, sparks fly and it's Mia's turn to question if her marriage is everything she wants out of life. Searching for answers, Mia dives head first into dating Noah, falling further away from her husband and closer to her old flame.
But Declan's not giving up so easily. Mia is his one and only and he's not about to let another man win her heart.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18072325-man-of-my-dreams,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376488783m/18072325.jpg,25372786,"Man of My Dreams (Dreams, #1)",Romance,star man of my dream is faith andrew debut novel and i have to say i really enjoyed it i felt that the character were extremely believable and well thought out i think she did a great job a far a the editing and development of the story line it is not often that you read a debut novel that is a well edited a this one that score bonus point with me i tend to be a stickler for editing any way enough of that mia ha been in love with noah since the day she set eye on him freshman year of high school she ha hoped that some way some how they would become a couple mia s best friend grace try to tell her to just give up on up on noah and move on but she continues to pine away for him by senior year they have had a few class together but nothing more ever developed realizing that they will be nothing more than acquaintance mia head off to college declan ha just started college and ha set his sight on mia only having had one real serious relationship in high school he is hesitant to approach mia but he feel this unbelievable pull towards her and after a month of careful consideration he make his move after dating for a few year they find themselves married and with their first child on the way mia is teaching and declan ha accepted a position with an accounting firm what seems to be the perfect marriage on the surface is not the case declan is spending longer hour at work and is now required to travel more often when he is caught in a lie mia s trust in him is tested and when she can no longer accept his apology for a mistake he make while at work she throw him out when the opportunity arises for mia to attend her year high school reunion she jump at it she realizes that she may get to see noah again and maybe just maybe she can see if it will lead anywhere i love the depth of the character how faith writes such a believable story stuff like this happens in everyday life i for one can say that those first few year of marriage are awesome and then kid come into the picture and we are now trying to juggle how to be a mom and a wife and somehow the wife get lost in all of that patience is tested loved one who should be our top priority no longer are and we slowly fall apart being a stay at home mom is what mia want she love her child with all her heart but at the end of the day she is exhausted and just want to call it a night without realizing it she is pushing declan away and the only way he know to deal with it is to bury himself in his work declan love mia and his girl more than life itself but he doe not know how to communicate with her anymore he ha felt them pulling apart for sometime but doe not realize that he is equally responsible for the issue that lie between them when he make that one mistake that sends their marriage into chaos he doesn t know how to fix it begging to come home and professing his undying love to mia doe not do the trick when his mistake send mia into the arm of another man declan realizes that he need to step up his game if he is going to win the love of his life back i miss you mia please let me come home i will never stop fighting for u i love you this story is a roller coaster ride of emotion i wanted to scream cry jump for joy pout and beat them all up at some point the only reason why i did not give this star is because i felt that the ending wa rushed declan make one last ditch effort to win mia back and i felt that it all happened way to fast other than that i really enjoyed this story go and one click it today you will not be disappointed,0.998

I was in love with the writing and the whole story about 70/80% of it's entirety. The ending 20/30% killed it for me. \n The beginning of the story is written beautifully. I love how our MC, Blythe thinks and how her feelings are describe. I love the scene where she meet Chris Shepherd. The middle was not as good, but the characters are ones you can't help but love. You become involved with each one's story and pull for them all. \n I fell in love with Blythe and Chris, and really loved them together. Well I loved everything but how creepy quick they loved each other. That was a little much for my tastes. Besides that, they really help make each stronger, and I love how their stories fit together, even it was a bit over the top and predictable. They are both very relate able characters, and you want to cry, laugh, and even hug them at times. \n The ending of the book to me, felt like it was written by a completely different person. Some of the events that occur were a little too soap opera like for me to enjoy or believe. It went from a very beautifully written story to a rushed one and like that of most new adult books. There is just so much drama that it gets old. Some of the scenes and lines were so corny I just wanted to DNF it right there because of it! It bothered me so bad that I couldn't give it more then a 3.5. \n If you like New Adult, this is one to check out. I now plan on reading other books written by Jessica Park because of how much I loved the first 2/3ish of the book. I am curious to read more of what others thought as well. I have read a lot of mixed reviews, so you might just be another person who loves it. It just ended up falling way short for me. \n Find more of my reviews @ Caught Reading Redheaded""",4.14,"What does it take to rise from life's depths, swim against the current, and breathe?

There was so much emotion and I could really relate to a lot of the feelings throughout. Blythe and Chris meet and you can just tell the chemistry is there from the beginning, but they both have some serious issues in their past that they still haven't quite dealt with completely. It seems as though fate has brought them together in many ways and Blythe ends up becoming friends with Chris's whole family. This helps her to start to deal with her issues from the past but still not enough for her and Chris to be more than friends, which seems to be working for them so it's okay, right? Wrong. \n I really enjoyed how Chris helped Blythe with her running. I can relate to this because I just started running and for some of the same reasons that Blythe is running. I am really curious as to what the songs are that Chris gives her for her running playlists. Music is a big part of this but it isn't until the end that we find out what a few of the songs were. \n The story progresses pretty slowly but not in a bad way, it gives you a false sense of security. Everything is going great and then BAM everything changes and it is in someways devastating. It was somewhat unexpected even though the ending itself was a tad predictable, but that might just be me. I over analyze everything in hopes of guessing the ending before getting there. \n I really enjoyed this book a lot. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good read.""",4.14,"What does it take to rise from life's depths, swim against the current, and breathe?

Left Drowning is an amazing story of different kinds of heartbreak love, and the need to understand that sometimes it is okay to lean on others to get through rough patches in life. Blythe McGuire has spent the last four years at college simply going through the motions and getting by; but unable to move on from the tragic loss of her parents. Her relationship with her only relative, her brother James, is strained at best and she has managed to not make a single friend at Matthews College in the three years she has been there. Suddenly, in one day she makes two new friends who turn out to be brothers. Quirky and energetic Sabin introduces himself to Blythe by stealing her coffee. After going their separate ways, Blythe finds herself at the lake near campus observing Christopher skipping stones and learns that he is Sabin's brother. Further, their twin siblings Eric and Estelle also attend Matthews. Out of nowhere Blythe suddenly has a new support group to help her move on from her past. Chris is especially helpful, but pushes her away for fear of sharing his own past. Together the group works together to come to terms with each of their pasts and to embrace the future. \n This book was so well written. From the first page I related to Blythe and was pulled into her story. As she overcomes obstacles and pushes herself to take better care of herself, she learns a lot about herself and healing and the need to rely on her friends to get through hard times. Once she learns that lesson, she eventually gets Chris to understand the same lesson. Left Drowning is about overcoming grief be it for a lost childhood, a lost parent, or perhaps even losing oneself. It was a bit of an emotional roller coaster, but it offered so much insight into dealing with the different twists life throws our way. In June, I reviewed the Edge of Never and called it my favorite book that I have read in 2013. I think Left Drowning just nudged it out of first place. This book was a riveting tale of friendship, love, forgiveness, and learning to live. I loved it!""",4.14,"What does it take to rise from life's depths, swim against the current, and breathe?

Ms. Park created a world with 6 amazing characters that I fell in love with and immediately adopted into my own family. On top of all that I learned she is an evil genius who likes to torture her readers wickedly, more on that later. \n The world of Left Drowning centers on Blythe McGuire and Chris Shepherd. Through meeting Chris a lonely Blythe is wrapped into a group of friends she would never have thought she could have. Chris, Sabin (Who I am hoping gets a story of his own some day!), Estelle and Eric all bring Blythe into their intimate circle of friendship and love helping to transform not only her but them as well. \n This world was so real and so emotionally raw for me. The magic Ms. Park wields in her ability to create a world so vivid and bold, evoking emotions in myself that are normally detached from me when reading, is astounding. Her words are so powerful I couldn\'t help but feel everything that Blythe felt, and in essence I became Blythe as I read and it made the experience 10x more profound than I expected. \n The anticipation and excitement I felt as Blythe and Chris interacted was so enticing. I was feeling the butterflies and the raw sexual energy that Blythe felt. I ached for Chris to have her and was driven damn near crazy myself as I waited and hoped for that moment to come. The way the steam scenes were written with anticipation and longing heightened the reading experience and set me on fire. \n Let me start this next part by stating I don\'t cry easy. I didn\'t cry when I got married or had my two girls which is something that I know makes a lot of people cry, heck my husband even cried when we got married. What makes me cry? Well lets see physical pain makes me cry like stubbing my toe really bad, or if someone where to hit me. I also cry when I see an animal hurt, I mean that is just horrible stuff so how couldn\'t I cry when an animal is in pain. \n So anyways, there have been many books that are emotional or angsty and have made my eyes glisten with unshed tears. That is the important thing is I never dropped a tear. Well guess what, apparently Ms. Park made me stub my toe after ramming my funny bone into something hard and then forced me watch as she kicked my imaginary puppy. Why the hell did you have to be so mean to me?!?!! What did I do to you?! My word I would never have thought someone so sweet looking could be so violent and wicked! I mean she must have done all those things to me since 69% of the way through (not 70% and I don\'t care how naughty yelling ""69 killed me"" sounds!) a gorgeously written book I was actually crying, I mean tears coming down my cheeks and a runny nose! My heart, my poor freaking heart was in agony, I felt my chest constrict even. I was literally feeling crushed by what I had just read. I was not able to shit rainbows! \n If that isn\'t talent, I don\'t know what is. To actually make me feel exactly as the character was feeling. I was living in the world created by Ms. Park in this book. I was Blythe. Well, of course after being made to feel like complete shit I had to keep reading until late into the night because damn it I wanted to feel better. Thankfully I carried on and soon found my heart healing, and I was able to move on which made the lack of sleep I am feeling this morning worth it. \n This is a good long novel at 399 pages, a standalone that wont leave you hanging on a cliffhanger. All I can hope for is there will be perhaps a companion novel someday for some of the other amazing friends I made while reading this book. \n So yes, I felt this book deserved more than the standard 5/5, it was at least a 6/5 for me. Lord only knows how many more of my imaginary puppies Ms. Park would kick if I gave her any less ;)'",4.14,"What does it take to rise from life's depths, swim against the current, and breathe?

Love all the characters in the book because they felt real and believable. You felt their pain, sorrow, loss, and love. \n ""Don\'t you see, Chris? You and I are supposed to be together. There is always a choice. This is not an obligation or a duty. But our lives are entwined, they have been, for good reasons. I\'ve known that from the moment I set eyes on you. It never made sense to me before. How I felt so deeply connected to you before we\'d even spoken. But I did, and I do."" \n Left Drowning is an emotional compelling story of Blythe McGuire who lost her parents in a tragic house when she was 17 years old. Her brother, James and her were luckily able to escape and survive the tragic accident. The loss of her parents has tragically shaped and changed the lives of Blythe and James. Four years later, Blythe is a very sad, self depreciating damaged and depressed girl. She\'s been living in a numb, almost lifeless state until she meets The Shepherd siblings. (Sabin, Chris, Estella and Eric) \n She meets Chris Shepherd. She feels an inexplicable connection to Chris, and he brings out feelings in her that she has long since buried. Along with Chris\' two brothers, Sabin and Eric, and their sister, Estelle, Blythe is saved from drowning. They teach her to breathe again. The Shepard clan becomes the family she is missing. Along the way, Blythe reconnects with her brother James and other close family friends. Blythe learns to take charge of her life. Chris gives Blythe hope.. \n However, Chris and his family also have demons in their past. Blythe wants to be there for Chris, to help him like he did her, but he keeps her at arms length. She makes him feel too much, makes him remember his troubled past, and he doesn\'t want that, he only wants to move forward with his life. They both have emotional and physical scars. Blythe and Chris past and future are connected. Although, they don\'t believe in faith and God but they were destined to meet each other. Their physical scars fits together like a puzzle and they were meant for each other. \n ""I am overwhelmingly in love with you, Chris says as he matches my steps. ""I\'ve spent most of my life thinking that my father never gave me anything but pain. But that\'s not true. He did give me something. Someone. You. He gave me you. Last summer, you asked me to believe in us. I don\'t believe in much, as you know, but I do damn well believe in us. Forever."" \n ""We\'ll make it to that finish line, won\'t we, Blythe?"" .....

I figured Prom and Prejudice would be based on the original, but I wasn't entirely sure what would happen since I didn't know anything about it. \n Turns out that the story is very similar to the original, all the way down to the names used for the characters - I read a synopsis of Pride & Prejudice when I was finished and was kind of astonished at how similar they were. Though, for all I know, this is how all adaptations are done. I mean, obviously some things were changed - our plot revolves around the prom, for example. I'm not sure how some people read adaptation after adaptation if they really are exactly the same, but we all like different things I guess :) \n I enjoyed myself throughout the story. It teaches the reader about prejudice (imagine that), and has a little bit of a complex storyline (what with all of the different relationships and families, anyway). I was actually sincerely shocked at one of the twists, which I think even those familiar with the original may find surprising (though maybe not, I'm not sure). Of course, I enjoy a good romance, and there is certainly a good amount of that in this book. Each of the characters had a distinctive personality, and I did really like Lizzie (our main character). \n Prom and Prejudice would be a great gateway to the actual novel it is based on.

I have to confess that I haven\'t read ""Pride and Prejudice"" (I know I\'ve lost all credibility), but I figured I could give this book a chance. I wasn\'t really expecting much.

Although I\'m sure it pales in comparison to the real thing, I felt that this novel actually had substance and personality. I liked Lizzie, the main character, and she seemed like a real person. She definitely had flaws but she was also pretty nice. The other characters were well developed too with the exception of Lizzie\'s roommate,Jane. Jane was so nice and cloyingly sweet she reminded me of Melanie from ""Gone With the Wind."" Her character was just too darn clueless. How could she think so highly of everyone after the way so many people in the school treated her good friend? \n Also, some of the dialogue is a bit misleading? At first I was confused about the time period of the story. I thought it was modern day but then some character would say something like, ""so and so were smitten with each other"" and I\'d think maybe this is the 1800\'s. No self-respecting teenager, no matter how rich, smart or well-educated says ""smitten."" Have you ever heard Nate Archibald or Blair Waldorf say ""smitten?"" \n Oh well, over all this was an enjoyable story and had enough twists and unusual characters to keep it interesting.

After winter break, the girls at the very prestigious Longbourn Academy become obsessed with the prom. Lizzie Bennet, who attends Longbourn on a scholarship, isn't interested in designer dresses and expensive shoes, but her best friend, Jane, might be - especially now that Charles Bingley is back from a semester in London.

I must say.... \n I have to say that yes, this is the best Nicole Reed book she has put out to date. I loved all her other books but Beautiful Ink takes the cake in my opinion. She has shown a different side to her writing then she has ever before. I was speechless when I was finished because I couldn\'t wrap my mind around Nicole writing this book because it was so different than what she has given us in the past. The growth I saw in her as a writer made my heart happy for her. \n When I was first digging into Beautiful Ink I thought I was in store for another wonderful biker MC book but Nicole surprised me because even though yes, there is a bike gang in this book, the story is so much more than that. The whole biker MC plays a small roll in this book but is very important to the storyline. I loved how she took a topic that is so widely written about but clearly made it her own and unique because it\'s not about a bad boy biker at all, Beautiful Ink, is about a girl Keller who is trying to escape the past that has haunted her for just about ever. A past so dark and twisted that she is forever looking over her shoulder make sure her that the next step taken and the next breath exhaled will not be her last. \n ""Blood in and blood out,"" he says, kissing my neck in between his words. ""Your fucking choice. But know this, it is forever now my blood that runs through your veins. And I will drown you in it, before I will let you escape me."" \n Not only does Nicole delivery the suspense that I love so much in books but she gives me the hope that something beautiful will come out at the end. My heart was beating fast while reading this and goose bumps covered my skin. Beautiful Ink is raw and gritty. It\'s dark and dangerous and at times downright disturbing but Nicole delivery\'s it flawlessly and made me hang onto every word.

FINE. \n Alec Drummond is a billionaire agri-business mogul living in Munich--and he\'s got a reputation for shooting first when his financial interests are in jeopardy. He\'s not happy that a CIA operative, Gaige Owens, makes it into the nerve center of his cybersecurity offices. Naturally, Gaige isn\'t really CIA, he\'s actually a guy in limbo, left to twist in the wind by his former partner and compelled into action by the CIA Special Acitivites Division officer Seth Lang. Gaige\'s ex did a bad job of hacking some high-level places and framed Gaige for the dirty deeds, and Seth\'s holding Gaige\'s feet to the fire for his own purposes. \n Gaige is sure Alec will kill him, but Seth set up this meeting to demonstrate Gaige\'s abilities to Alec, as a way to get Alec to take Gaige on as an operative. See, Alec\'s company makes quarterly deposits to the Doomsday Bank for seeds to ensure food security. Unfortunately, there\'s been some shady deposits there in the last six months. Extra deposits that no one seems to know about, but were seemingly arranged by Alec himself. \n As little as Alec wants him, he grudgingly accepts Gaige into his company--and his private residence--so he can keep a very close eye on him. It\'s clear that Gaige is a gifted hacker, and a sexy young man, but Alec doesn\'t want any part of that...at first. As they end up the subject of a couple of fatal attempts on their lives, Alec and Gaige get closer out of necessity. And, that\'s some more dirty deeds right there, folks. As the danger intensifies, Gaige and Alec recognize the answers they need are buried in the seed vaults in Svalbard. Not that it comes together easy. Nope, it\'s a rough situation and results in double-crosses by members of Alec\'s most intimate circle. \n In this romantic suspense, we\'ve got spies, CIA, powerful men, assassins, and a plot that could endanger the food security of nations. It\'s interesting and intriguing with a pace that keeps the pages turning. Both Gaige and Alec despise Seth and his machinations, but they work out their personal differences without too much difficulty in order to discover the plot to sabotage Alec\'s business and reputation. \n This series seems to revolve around the Drummond brothers--all three of them--and Alec is the stalwart one who\'s not willing to even look for love. His family has some dark secrets, and it really colored his outlook. That said, Alec\'s curiosity about Gaige leads to more than partnership, even if it\'s ""no strings"". They get tied up quick enough, nonetheless, and Alec got over his ingrained aversion to relationships because Gaige was worth the effort. Gaige is a little bit of a wisecracker, and I so wanted him to get into a good relationship after all the hub-bub of his horrible ex. \n I\'m expecting the next book to feature Alec\'s brother, Finn, and I\'m looking forward to it! I received a review copy via NetGalley.'",3.83,"No dirty deed goes unnoticed in a seductive game of cat and mouse. But for Alec and Gaige, the wrong move could get them killed.
Alec Drummond didn't make his billions by playing nice--or by playing much at all. When it comes to pleasure, Alec only has time for whatever's quick and easy, which is exactly what he gets from his company's hot new computer genius. But Gaige Owens isn't some pushover. He pushes back, and it's giving Alec a rush. The question is, could Gaige be the one who's leaking trade secrets? Just to be safe, Alec keeps him close at hand . . . night andday.
Gaige never thought he'd roll over for a man like Alec again, but who could resist sex this mind-blowing? Then there's the draw of Alec's mysterious side: his cutthroat ambition, his covert CIA connections, and the murder in his past. For Gaige, a deeper look proves an irresistible temptation. But when Gaige and Alec are stripped of their defenses by an unseen danger, everything they don't know could bring them closer together--or tear them apart.

Their owner died unexpectedly a month ago, and team morale wasn\'t good before that tragedy. He\'s not enthused when the team\'s new owner, Peyton Fox-only heir of their deceased boss-steps in to whip this team into shape. Not that he can\'t respect a woman; he and Payton shared one night of carnal bliss the night Rafe was drafted to her team-and he had to stay away to keep his job, not because he didn\'t want her. \n Peyton Fox wants to rebuild her father\'s legacy. Now. She\'d been working for another team to stay far away from Rafe and all his shenanigans, but her only current choices are to save the Carolina Crush, or sell them. To save them, she needs to work with Rafe-even if it means putting her heart, and the emotoinal well-being of her ""fatherless"" son at risk. See, Call has a daddy, he\'s just never met him in person. And Payton\'s not quite sure how to bridge that gap with Rafe. She\'d been infatuated by him and infuriated that Rafe walked away without as second glance. \n So, I think people who like sports romance, and sexy-sexy books will find this one right in their wheelhouse. The pace is rapid with the bulk of the story occurring in preseason training, with Peyton being an extremely \'hands-on\' owner. Rafe is a good guy with strong family values, and he\'s determined to do things right with Payton this second time around. Add in his discovery of Cal, and he\'s downright giddy to be a dad, even if he\'s missed a whole lot. Payton\'s reticent to reveal her big secret, but she does the deed eventually. This puts their rekindled romance on the backfield for a bit, but these folks really like being in each other\'s spaces so they work it out with little blood, sweat or tears. The story also gets at the rebuilding of the football team, so expect a good bit of posturing and trash-talk.

When the tough-as-nails chick takes over as team owner, Rafe is ready to turn the epic-fail season into a Super Bowl championship. But the winning has to start with Peyton's love.
No stranger to playason and off the field, Peyton Fox is born and bred NFL royalty. Been there, done him, and called the plays even before she took up the Carolina Crush crown. She has zero time for a love life and even less time for games unless they happen between the endzones. Unfortunately, Rafe Macintyre has one hell of an arm, and he's full of hot southern charm.

A year ago he broke off his relationship with his cheating ex, Christian, a successful attorney. Since then, Marty is pretended to be dating ""Tim,"" an underwear model based in LA. As Marty\'s sister\'s wedding draws near, the pressure is on to produce Tim, or \'fess up. Problem is, Christian is best friends with Sophia\'s fiance, so admitting his lie will embarrass Marty in front of his family and his ex. \n Luke Myers is an FBI agent whose deep cover has been blown sky-high. Trying to nail El Dragon, a notorious Mexican drug lord, has been his objective for the past several years, and he has to go in hiding just when El Dragon is poised to appear on U.S. soil. Still, a chance meeting with Marty outside a gay club may provide the cover Luke needs...if he will pretend to be Tim. \n There\'s a bit of quid pro quo going on, and Marty is a terrible, but touching, blackmailer, or so Luke thinks. He\'s used to being a one night stand, but Marty\'s so sweet and (mostly) innocent that Luke is drawn to him--and his intrusive, but loving, family. \n There are certainly enemies in their midst, as Luke\'s identity could only have been leaked by fellow agents. Marty\'s close family is straight and narrow (well, Marty\'s not straight) law-abiding folks who work hard and live right. The idea that some of his family have gone astray isn\'t in Marty\'s head much, until he\'s confronted with some very real bad guys that Luke needs to manage. The misapprehension that Marty has concerning Luke\'s true identity is amusing, and allows for some fun conflicts. Also, Luke\'s guise as Tim is so fun--he\'s adored and abhorred, by turns. Expect Christian to have a hand in the latter. \n I was amused and engaged in this one from the beginning. I love the fake boyfriend trope, and thought it was well executed, especially as Marty and Luke are strangers who end up falling for one another. That part was also well done. Marty\'s family is the type that won\'t quit-and their tenacity was honest and well-meant, even if they are meddlesome and overbearing-in the ""I love you so much I\'m going to ENSURE you have a good life"" way, which was more charming than chafing, to me. There\'s a lot of action in the book, with the wedding and the shake down of the baddies, so the pace is hopping. It\'s the beginning of a series, and I\'d totally grab the next book.'",3.69,"Two men, one lie, and a whole bunch of trouble.
Marty Valdez is in serious trouble. His sister's wedding is around the corner, and everyone expects to meet Marty's super-successful underwear model boyfriend--whom Marty invented. Now Marty has to produce a half-naked hottie or suffer the worst humiliation of his life.
FBI agent Luke Myers is in serious trouble. He's been working undercover to take down a dangerous drug cartel, but his cover's blown and he needs to disappear. Luckily, a geeky yet intriguing comic book artist gives him the perfect opportunity. Luke just has to pretend to be his boyfriend, and pretending is what he does best.

He\'s serving a summer as an unpaid intern in his BFFs father\'s ad company, and pretty much hating life. A Lot. Jacob wants a man, he feels like a fuddy-duddy, and is currently having a major hopeless crush on the newest employee at Ethan\'s tat shop: Cody, the piercer. \n Cody\'s a wet-dream of a man, in Jacob\'s opinion. Tall and lithe, with long blonde hair, amazing tats, and soooo many piercings. His junk could set off the TSA body scanners, I bet. Jacob doesn\'t know this, at first, he just hangs out at Ethan\'s job mooning over Cody, wishing Cody was gay. Or bi. Or bi-curious... \n Thing is, they really hit it off, and it turns out the Cody is totally gay, just not interested----in getting Jacob mixed up in Cody\'s messed up life. And that\'s not cool in Jacob\'s opinion. This book was so refreshing, with it\'s motley cast of hell-raising tat artists, poor schmucky Jacob, and Princess Andi, Jacob\'s bestie who is also Ethan\'s girlfriend. I really dug the total dynamic, and the twists this book took were beyond the pale. \n Ethan gets in trouble for running pot for disabled vets who can\'t get a legal prescription filled, as a favor to his business partner. Turns out the ""po-po"" (NYPD) had been tipped off, and that brings the Russian mob, corrupt cops, Cody\'s drug-running ex, and a masquerading old Slovak woman into the mix. We don\'t know where the danger lay, but we do know that Jacob will save his brother any which way he can, and Cody feels indebted to The Brothers Shain for their assistance in his recent domestic problems, so he\'s down for a Dumpster dive or a covert op, when needed. \n I loved how Jacob and Cody totally bonded. They are ""geeks of a feather"" and that was really cool for this geek to read. Jacob\'s an upstanding guy--and pretty much hysterically neurotic--so he\'s all about not pressuring Cody into doing anything physical--while he\'s also doing a serious solid for Cody. Can\'t have the beautiful man feel beholden, or anything. Oy vey. It\'s Cody who makes the moves here, and he\'s so smitten with Jacob it\'s swoony. \n Expect bad guys who try to hurt good guys, funny guys who make fun of not funny guys, a couple of covert ops run by absolute novices--seriously, it\'s like me and my sisters trying to take down a gang--that result in amazing stand-offs and heroic deeds. I really don\'t want to give the plot away, but I can tell you this one ends on a really high note, and it\'s only the beginning of the series. \n Also, Jacob and Cody totally get it on, and Jacob learns the benefits of metal-augmented male appendages. *wink wink* I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.'",3.66,"The deepest scars aren't the ones that show.
Jacob Shain is your average member of Generation Screwed. He has a boring internship, no cash flow, and a tiny NYC apartment he has to share with Ethan, his much-cooler, tattoo-artist twin brother. Not to mention his love life is DOA. At least, until his brother's shop hires on a new piercer, and Jacob's humdrum life takes a turn for the weird.
Cody Turner is gorgeous, funny and kind--everything Jacob wants in a boyfriend. Except for the way he refuses to talk about his past, or where he lives, or anything about his personal life.
When Ethan is arrested while on a mission of mercy, the reason Cody is so tight lipped comes to light. And while Jacob and Cody fight to understand the depth of their feelings for one another, the police dogs catch their scent. So does the local mob.
Now Jacob has to make the hardest choice of his life: stay safe like a good boy, or dive headfirst into a world he barely understands...and hope Cody is there to break his fall.

(Alex had been wanted by the FBI due to fabricated charges and double-agent shenanigans. Hunter was shot in the kerfuffle, and is still recuperating.) They met when Alex was working at a busy, urban hospital emergency room together. Hunter is a Physician's Assistant, though he hasn't worked in six months due to recovery from his injury. Alex had his graduate school dreams derailed by the FBI manhunt and has since found a new purpose: joining the FBI to help root out bad agents, if he gets accepted. \n In the meantime, they accept a trip to the isolated Caribbean isle of Saba to spend time with old friends of Alex's mothers. Reunited with a childhood friend, Orfeo, Alex's budding Feeb senses begin to tingle--particularly when Orfeo's partner Max and his sister Talisha seem to get freaked out by Alex's desire to join the FBI. Hunter can't help noticing how agitated they become, too, so it's not only Alex getting worried about his friend's welfare. This is not an exaggeration; the island's first murder in a decade occurs a few days later, and the subject was a PI staying at Orfeo's hotel. Despite their worries, Alex and Hunter make a lot of headway into their own sexytimes--and Hunter considers making some serious declarations...of the marital type. If he can muster the nerve, that is. \n As a hurricane bears down on Saba the whole mystery becomes infinitely more deadly. And not just because of the weather. Max and Talisha have Really Bad Guys on their tail who are probably only the tip of the gargantuan iceberg of their problems. Expect a lot of hiding, scrabbling for incriminating details, and sexytimes. Oh, also, a hurricane, two desperate chases, dangerous criminals, and collaboration with known felons to hopefully make it out alive. It's an intriguing romantic suspense, and I'm sure we'll see more of Hunter and Alex in another book, likely set in Quantico, VA!""",4.12,"When Hunter and Alex (formally Shawn) are given the vacation of a lifetime, it's a chance for them to pay attention to romance and get out of the path of danger. The tiny Caribbean island of Saba is gorgeous, the first to have marriage equality, and the Sabans are the nicest people on earth.
There's lots of rum poolside for relaxing and a room with a mirror on the ceiling for passion. Hot karaoke nights, cold beer, and new friends.
Their new friends Orfeo and Max, and Max's sister Talisha, share a troubling secret. Alex and Hunter want to help. As a hurricane bears down on them, a dead body surfaces, and a purple backpack loaded with stolen jewels leads a pair of dangerous men to the island.
Alex would rather poke his own eyes out with a pointy stick than call on his old enemy Nick Truman for help; he'd also do anything to keep Hunter out of danger. But even his nemesis can't reach them now.
Once again, they only have each other to depend on as their paradise is about to become hell on earth.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29940158-send-lawyers-guns-and-roses,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1460989500m/29940158.jpg,50330765,"Send Lawyers, Guns, and Roses (Heart and Haven, #2)",Romance,this is the second book in a series and need to be read in order star for this contemporary m m romantic suspense alex and hunter are two men healing from a tragic event alex had been wanted by the fbi due to fabricated charge and double agent shenanigan hunter wa shot in the kerfuffle and is still recuperating they met when alex wa working at a busy urban hospital emergency room together hunter is a physician s assistant though he hasn t worked in six month due to recovery from his injury alex had his graduate school dream derailed by the fbi manhunt and ha since found a new purpose joining the fbi to help root out bad agent if he get accepted in the meantime they accept a trip to the isolated caribbean isle of saba to spend time with old friend of alex s mother reunited with a childhood friend orfeo alex s budding feeb sens begin to tingle particularly when orfeo s partner max and his sister talisha seem to get freaked out by alex s desire to join the fbi hunter can t help noticing how agitated they become too so it s not only alex getting worried about his friend s welfare this is not an exaggeration the island s first murder in a decade occurs a few day later and the subject wa a pi staying at orfeo s hotel despite their worry alex and hunter make a lot of headway into their own sexytimes and hunter considers making some serious declaration of the marital type if he can muster the nerve that is a a hurricane bear down on saba the whole mystery becomes infinitely more deadly and not just because of the weather max and talisha have really bad guy on their tail who are probably only the tip of the gargantuan iceberg of their problem expect a lot of hiding scrabbling for incriminating detail and sexytimes oh also a hurricane two desperate chase dangerous criminal and collaboration with known felon to hopefully make it out alive it s an intriguing romantic suspense and i m sure we ll see more of hunter and alex in another book likely set in quantico va,-0.6233

He's been on dialysis for the past seven years in the hopes of finding a suitable donor, but his kidney function is failing and he probably has less than a year to live, even with dialysis. He's 39 and facing his mortality. It's creeping up on what will likely be his last Christmas with his large and loving family, but his flight is cancelled when a blizzard grinds all transportation around Denver to a halt. \n Marc is a driven attorney, hell-bent on making partner at 38. He's sacrificed his entire adult life to be the kind of son his homophobic mother would be proud of, only to note that he has no life except work. Stranded in the white out, he makes his way to a nearby hotel and books a room for the night. Seeing Trevor in the cafe, Marc is immediately attracted. His invitation to sit and join him becomes a long conversation and a further invite to share his room once Trevor confesses that he was unable to get a room due to a sell-out. \n Neither man is really open to more than one night's solace, despite their incendiary passion. Trevor hasn't had a partner for years, and he's had even less of a libido for most of that time. Something about Marc stirs him, however. In the cold light of day neither Marc nor Trevor can admit they have more than lust boiling along, even if it's true. That said, Trevor doesn't want to reveal his illness and Marc knows a relationship will detract from his workaholic ways. Still, Marc can't abide with Trevor spending his Christmas Eve, and maybe longer, on a couch in the hotel's lobby. He invites Trevor to his beautiful and barren home outside Boulder. \n Trevor's reluctant to let any connection build between himself and Marc, but it happen anyway. They spend a fantastic Christmas together, Trevor coming clean about his illness and prognosis when Marc presses him for more than their three day fling when he returns from visiting his family. It is bittersweet and melancholy and heart-wrenching and wonderful that these two lonely souls find a spark in such dire times. \n I fully enjoyed the resolution to this one, which, I will state firmly, was an HEA. Marc's selfless offering of himself helped him to realize all that he had to offer others, and allowed him to break free of his self-loathing. I really liked how he engaged himself with his colleagues and found the best way to handle his very sad situation. Trevor is a man who has resolved himself on imminent death. He's afraid to hope one more, probably last, time. And it shows. He does find the courage to accept Marc's lifeline, however, and it proves the adage that life is always darkest before the dawn. \n I just plain loved this. It's a well-told strangers-to-lovers story that doesn't ooze sap, despite the medical realities of the plot. The Christmas aspect was balanced, with high and low points--love, loss, isolation, acceptance. I will admit to shedding a tear, or three. As a person with an even rarer blood type than Trevor, I sympathized with his plight. (I may B- but I will always be positive!) There aren't too many sexytimes, but they are all about the feels. Highly recommend! \n I received a review copy of this via NetGalley.""",4.02,"There are worse things than being stranded in a blizzard.
Artist Trevor Morrison has always appreciated the little things in life, treating each day as a gift. And with good reason: he's been on the transplant-recipient list for too long now. When he learns just how numbered his days truly are, he resolves not to take them for granted. But he won't be unrealistic, either--which means romantic commitments are off the table.
Marcus Roberts seems to have it all. He's handsome, financially sound, and on the fast track to partnership at a prestigious law firm. In reality, though, his drive for success has meant no time for friends or relationships. Add in the fact that his family discarded him long ago, and he's facing yet another holiday season alone.
When the biggest snowstorm to hit Colorado in decades leaves Marc and Trevor stranded at the same hotel, a chance encounter and a night of passion leads to more than either of them expected. Finding comfort in each other is a welcome surprise, but time is not on their side. Either they find a way to beat the odds, or they lose each other forever.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25854070-a-fortunate-blizzard,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438181030m/25854070.jpg,45722376,A Fortunate Blizzard,Romance,oh man this one got me right in the feel trevor is a successful artist in the end stage of renal disease he s been on dialysis for the past seven year in the hope of finding a suitable donor but his kidney function is failing and he probably ha le than a year to live even with dialysis he s and facing his mortality it s creeping up on what will likely be his last christmas with his large and loving family but his flight is cancelled when a blizzard grind all transportation around denver to a halt marc is a driven attorney hell bent on making partner at he s sacrificed his entire adult life to be the kind of son his homophobic mother would be proud of only to note that he ha no life except work stranded in the white out he make his way to a nearby hotel and book a room for the night seeing trevor in the cafe marc is immediately attracted his invitation to sit and join him becomes a long conversation and a further invite to share his room once trevor confesses that he wa unable to get a room due to a sell out neither man is really open to more than one night s solace despite their incendiary passion trevor hasn t had a partner for year and he s had even le of a libido for most of that time something about marc stir him however in the cold light of day neither marc nor trevor can admit they have more than lust boiling along even if it s true that said trevor doesn t want to reveal his illness and marc know a relationship will detract from his workaholic way still marc can t abide with trevor spending his christmas eve and maybe longer on a couch in the hotel s lobby he invite trevor to his beautiful and barren home outside boulder trevor s reluctant to let any connection build between himself and marc but it happen anyway they spend a fantastic christmas together trevor coming clean about his illness and prognosis when marc press him for more than their three day fling when he return from visiting his family it is bittersweet and melancholy and heart wrenching and wonderful that these two lonely soul find a spark in such dire time i fully enjoyed the resolution to this one which i will state firmly wa an hea marc s selfless offering of himself helped him to realize all that he had to offer others and allowed him to break free of his self loathing i really liked how he engaged himself with his colleague and found the best way to handle his very sad situation trevor is a man who ha resolved himself on imminent death he s afraid to hope one more probably last time and it show he doe find the courage to accept marc s lifeline however and it prof the adage that life is always darkest before the dawn i just plain loved this it s a well told stranger to lover story that doesn t ooze sap despite the medical reality of the plot the christmas aspect wa balanced with high and low point love loss isolation acceptance i will admit to shedding a tear or three a a person with an even rarer blood type than trevor i sympathized with his plight i may b but i will always be positive there aren t too many sexytimes but they are all about the feel highly recommend i received a review copy of this via netgalley,0.9967

I cannot comment on the previous story, as I didn't read it. \n Rick Steele is a dealer in Vegas. He's been jilted and he's jaded. His buddy convinces him to sign up for FANTA C, a one night stand service that guarantees a perfect match. Rick's not convinced, but he is wowed by curvy Tara who shows up for their date. \n Tara is just getting on her feet after spending three plus years with an abuser she had to disappear from. Her body is covered in scars and cigarette burns from her ex. That's nothing compared to her emotional wounds, however. She's afraid of Rick, on account of him being so big and sexy. How could he ever find her desirable? \n Well, Rick's a (supposed) Dom and he needs to make his partners feel safe and cherished. He works all of Tara's insecurities to the outer limits. I liked their chemistry, and how compassionate Rick was. Her really did give Tara a fantastic night, and he wanted more and more of her. Today, tomorrow and for the foreseeable future. \n She declined, on account of still needing to take care of herself outside of a relationship, but there's a reconnection to be made, and happiness to find. \n This is a short, sexy read that is way low on the BDSM scale. Mostly there's a teeny bit of domination. Rick claims to enjoy bondage, but Tara will not submit to that after her dark history of abuse. Still, they find a pleasurable middle ground.

As always, Ms. Probst reels you in with her sensual and touching story-line of a young woman rediscovering her inner strength, beauty and confidence. When Rick Steele meets Tara Denton through an exclusive club that fulfills fantasies, he was instantaneously attracted to her beauty and the strong connection that they shared that one night. But unfortunately for Tara, she was not at that point in her life to start a relationship after being in an abusive relationship for years. Will Rick be able to show Tara that he will wait for her? And will Tara be able to realize that her scars do not define her? \n Personally, there is nothing like reading a Jennifer Probst book. She has a way of making you smile after each book. I enjoyed reading this quick novella but wished for a little more in the ending since it was a bit abrupt for me. But overall, Ms. Probst will douse you with hot steamy romance that is filled with hope and new beginnings for Tara an Rick. \n Review can also be found on Four Chicks Flipping Pages: http://fourchicksflippingpages.weebly...Jennifer Probst'",3.53,"Rick Steele has avoided relationships since he caught his fiancee cheating, but when he's talked into a one night stand through Madame Eve, he's not prepared for his emotional and physical reaction to his date.

They wanted him to repent and ""change"" but he couldn\'t/wouldn\'t and he floundered, even getting incarcerated for a brief time. When he was released he took to ranching, working as a hand anywhere that would accept him, always on the move. Roe had dropped out of school early due to a learning disability and insensitive teaching methods. He has an incredibly low self-esteem, and doesn\'t make friends. He ends up in rural Nebraska, the Nowhere Ranch, and is mortified to find the ranch owner out one night at the only gay bar within a 3 hour drive. \n Travis is an older (40ish) out gay man who tried to make it as a straight man. He married, confessed, endured counseling, and divorced years ago. He\'s a retired math professor running a sheep and cattle ranch because he likes the isolation. He had come out with a lover, but those days are long past. Seeing his newest ranch hand at the gay bar is a blessing in disguise, especially as Roe is compatible with Travis\' kink. Trav is a Dom and Roe loves to feel degraded sexually. The kink in this book is not the standard BDSM fare, but it is intense. I almost died when Trav asked Roe if he had a ""safe word"" and Roe replies ""I\'m partial to \'no.\' "" (The deadpan language was just right for me.) \n Roe narrates the whole book, which is written in retrospective voice, detailing how Roe found his ""home;"" and this home on Nowhere Ranch is truly spectacular. He is a down-to-earth guy who has few needs and fewer desires. He wants a simple life and no relationships, yet, once he and Travis dance around a bit, it becomes clear that their compatibility extends far outside the bedroom. Roe is hounded by his bad memories of home, and some contacts from his family are clearly destructive to his well-being. Trav is a compassionate man, though not outwardly. All Trav\'s emotions are locked up tight, but the way he handles Roe, they way he looks after his welfare, is very sweet. \n The sex is...whoa. Might be someplace on the solar flare scale. Just, yeah. Extreme at times and sweet only because it is exactly what Roe wants. The emotional landscape of this book is multi-layered, with two men who are so afraid of being hurt that they can barely acknowledge their needs. It is a relationship built almost out of convenience, if we didn\'t know how incendiary their attraction really is. How their lives become intertwined was really awesome. I appreciated how Roe made solid, stable friends, how he was a significant force behind the ranch\'s business, how he learned to love himself and care for himself and his future. I loved how fiercely Trav took care of Roe, and I adored Haley--Roe\'s closest friend who was an amazing ally. \n If this book were a food, it would have been a double chocolate lava cake; I devoured it as though it were. Yum.'",4.01,"Love will grow through the cracks you leave open.
Ranch hand Roe Davis absolutely never mixes business with pleasure--until he runs into his boss, Travis Loving, at the only gay bar within two hundred miles.
Getting involved with the ranch owner is a bad idea, but Roe's and Travis's bedroom kinks line up against one another like a pair of custom-cut rails. As long as they're both clear this is sex on the side, no relationship, no interfering with the job, they could make it work.
Shut out by his family years ago, Roe survived by steadfastly refusing to settle into so much as a post office box. As his affair with Travis grows into more than just sex, Roe's past catches up with him, threatening the thin ray of happiness he's found, reminding him it's well past time he went on his way.
But even a loner gets lonely, and at this point, there's nowhere left to run. The shame and sorrow of what he's lost will stay with Roe wherever he goes--until he's ready to let love lead him home.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24979204-nowhere-ranch,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1424885720m/24979204.jpg,14101342,Nowhere Ranch,Romance,i picked this up the second i got wind that it wa on amazon praise god for facebook tip offs roe is a y o gay farmer whose family kicked him out of the house family farm when they discovered he wa gay they wanted him to repent and change but he couldn t wouldn t and he floundered even getting incarcerated for a brief time when he wa released he took to ranching working a a hand anywhere that would accept him always on the move roe had dropped out of school early due to a learning disability and insensitive teaching method he ha an incredibly low self esteem and doesn t make friend he end up in rural nebraska the nowhere ranch and is mortified to find the ranch owner out one night at the only gay bar within a hour drive travis is an older ish out gay man who tried to make it a a straight man he married confessed endured counseling and divorced year ago he s a retired math professor running a sheep and cattle ranch because he like the isolation he had come out with a lover but those day are long past seeing his newest ranch hand at the gay bar is a blessing in disguise especially a roe is compatible with travis kink trav is a dom and roe love to feel degraded sexually the kink in this book is not the standard bdsm fare but it is intense i almost died when trav asked roe if he had a safe word and roe reply i m partial to no the deadpan language wa just right for me roe narrates the whole book which is written in retrospective voice detailing how roe found his home and this home on nowhere ranch is truly spectacular he is a down to earth guy who ha few need and fewer desire he want a simple life and no relationship yet once he and travis dance around a bit it becomes clear that their compatibility extends far outside the bedroom roe is hounded by his bad memory of home and some contact from his family are clearly destructive to his well being trav is a compassionate man though not outwardly all trav s emotion are locked up tight but the way he handle roe they way he look after his welfare is very sweet the sex is whoa might be someplace on the solar flare scale just yeah extreme at time and sweet only because it is exactly what roe want the emotional landscape of this book is multi layered with two men who are so afraid of being hurt that they can barely acknowledge their need it is a relationship built almost out of convenience if we didn t know how incendiary their attraction really is how their life become intertwined wa really awesome i appreciated how roe made solid stable friend how he wa a significant force behind the ranch s business how he learned to love himself and care for himself and his future i loved how fiercely trav took care of roe and i adored haley roe s closest friend who wa an amazing ally if this book were a food it would have been a double chocolate lava cake i devoured it a though it were yum,0.9987

He\'s gay, and used to anonymous/casual sex. He finds his new gardener, Luke, attractive. He makes a move on the sexy young college student when he returns home late one night and finds Luke reading in his mansion\'s library. \n Luke isn\'t sure of his sexuality. He\'s been with a few women, but those one-off interactions didn\'t satisfy. He doesn\'t return Thomas\' advances, however, as he\'s still trying to determine how he feels about the attraction he experiences for his sexy boss. Willing to experiment--once--to test his potential homosexuality, he waits for Thomas the next evening. \n Thomas is more than eager to bed his nubile virgin. They have a fantastic night, but the next morning Thomas is standoffish. Doesn\'t want anything like a relationship to upset his demanding work schedule. So, he blows Luke off the next night--and Luke retreats to the edges, only doing his job. \n If Thomas realizes his mistake and apologizes, he might win Luke back. But, even that might not be enough. Spoiler...HEA. \n Okay, so this novella packs a lot of lovin\' into 44 pages. I didn\'t rate it higher for several reasons... \n First: the setting was ""america"", yet the diction, grammar and mannerisms were thoroughly Brit. Sorry, nothing lights my fury keg faster than a lack of authenticity. Change the setting, or write it \'Marican-style. See, when I chose this book, I knew it was coming out of Australia. I had hoped the setting would be Sydney, or Melbourne. If you fix that, you could avoid a full revision. Must be some uber-wealthy gay folk in Australia. Celebrate them--and the culture at home. If the book is well written Americans will read it. (For example, I love Brit Lit, and am a total Heller aficionado, but only because the writing is consistent with the regional settings.) \n Second: there was little character development. Too many times we heard how hard Thomas worked, and all we learned was he had long days. \n Third: Insta-Love. Thomas and Luke met on one day and had sex the next. It was one night, yet they both were ready to commit? Heck, Luke only just learned he liked dudes...it seems way too fast for him to decide Tommy is THE ONE. \n Fourth: Proof-read this one again. Too many spelling errors for an ""edited"" book.'",3.06,"He needed a job -- he never expected to need his boss.
Thomas's life can be pared down to one principle: Be as successful as possible by being as single-minded as possible. But his commitment to his goal is tested upon returning home to his mansion and finding his gorgeous new gardener in his library.
Luke is a student, and his new job is perfect: decent income and a place to study that's quiet, peaceful, and stocked with useful resources. The last thing he expects to find there is a stunning man who offers to open up all the doors that Luke has yet to be brave enough to peek behind.

I liked the theme of second chances, learning to let go of the past and moving ahead with your life. The characters were pretty well written, however, they were a bit frustrating. I felt that Francesca was incredibly naive for a 35 YO who owns her own art studio. With parents like hers, I would have thought she would be a little more worldly. I was disturbed by the way the roommates handled the situation of domestic abuse of one of their own. They claim to care about Eileen, yet don't really do anything to help her. I couldn't see how they were really shocked at the outcome of her situation. I felt that part of the book was unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the story. Also, I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever really does. \n It think the idea for the book was good, but the writing just didn't hold up for me. I think this story would have worked better in an anthology. It just didn't have enough to sustain a full novel. I was surprised at all of the repetition in the writing. The same ideas were repeated over and over. For example, how many times do I need to be told that Francesca doesn't like Internet dating or think it is a good idea? Cut out a lot of the repetition and you have a nice novella. \n This is my first Danielle Steele novel. I'm not sure if this is her usual way of writing.

And what a story it was. Killian for me has always been the mysterious dark horse in this series. Now we find out that there was quite the reason for Killian\'s dark side. However, we also find out what helps tame his inner beast. \n Savannah AKA Savvy has her own past but she always finds the good bits in everyone. This is part of the gift and curse that is Savvy for Killian.

Which is part of the reason he let her go. Now years later and Savvy has walked back into his life. This time around he won\'t make the same mistake twice. \n I absolutely loved Killian and Savvy together. Savvy was a strong kick ass heroine, while Killian was the most loyal protective man you could ask for. However, they both had their pasts to contend with. \n Throughout the years, Killian still knew what Savvy was to him and held that dear and near to his dark heart. I loved this part of Killian that he kept for her. Nashoda Rose has such a gift at creating beauty in a darker world. Kept from You wasn\'t nearly as dark as some of the others.

A first kiss that changed everything.
Killian Kane.
He was the most feared guy in high-school.
Guarded. Angry. A fighter.
But when I caught him watching me with his captivating green eyes I saw something more. Something protective and kind.
He warned me to stay away from him.
I did.
Until I didn't and he kissed me. A knee weakening, body tingling kiss that left me breathless. And scared the hell out of me.
And then...
He warned me never to come near him again or next time he wouldn't let me go.
That was eleven years ago.
We aren't teenagers anymore. He has probably forgotten me. He's a famous rock star now. I'm a dance instructor with a broken dream and desperate for a job.
So, when we cross paths again I don't expect him to remember me.
He does.
And his warning eleven years ago? I'm about to find out exactly what that meant.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25501128-kept-from-you,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1461732758m/25501128.jpg,45277960,"Kept from You (Tear Asunder, #4)",Romance,redeemed star source earc for honest review courtesy of author and book enthusiast promotion genre na dark romance part of an ongoing series my kept from you review finally we get killian kite kane s story and what a story it wa killian for me ha always been the mysterious dark horse in this series now we find out that there wa quite the reason for killian s dark side however we also find out what help tame his inner beast savannah aka savvy ha her own past but she always find the good bit in everyone this is part of the gift and curse that is savvy for killian he want her to find the good in him but he s also tortured enough to think he doesn t have any left and he doesn t deserve any good in his life because if you come near me again next time i won t let you go even though killian wa young when he met his savior he always knew the potential of her which is part of the reason he let her go now year later and savvy ha walked back into his life this time around he won t make the same mistake twice i absolutely loved killian and savvy together savvy wa a strong kick as heroine while killian wa the most loyal protective man you could ask for however they both had their past to contend with throughout the year killian still knew what savvy wa to him and held that dear and near to his dark heart i loved this part of killian that he kept for her nashoda rose ha such a gift at creating beauty in a darker world kept from you wasn t nearly a dark a some of the others actually it had more light and hope than the others which helped balance the series out however it s killian s past and fear that create the darkness within him the guy of tear asunder are all near and dear to my heart and i m so thankful we finally got killian s story thankfully we have a new character in town with trevor whom wa savvy s neighbor and we will soon get his story a well can t wait,0.9987

Bright Side wasn\'t only my best friend; she was like my other half . . .the other half of my brain, the other half of my conscience, the other half of my sense of humor, the other half of my creativity, the other half of my heart. How do you go back to doing what you did before, when half of you is gone forever? ~ \n After Bright Side, I immediately started to read Gus which was a gift and a curse. It was a curse because my heart hurt so much after Bright Side, that I should have given it a bit of rest before diving back in. However, it\'s also a gift, because Gus helps to ease the heart in the end. \n After the loss of Bright Side, Gus is devastated and is floundering through life. With no reason to really live and carry forward. He\'s going through the motions for the band, but not really experiencing anything. \n ""Gustov, you\'re stalling. You\'re wasting time. You\'re not living. You\'re not doing what you love."" \n God! Poor Gus, my heart broke along with him while he tried to find his bearings again. \n ""Have you ever been in love?"" He hasn\'t blinked. ""Once."" \n ""How long did last?"" Looking back up to the sky he answers. ""Twenty-one years . . . and three days."" \n Dude, my heart hurts for Gus. \n ""Listen to me, boy. You only get one chance at this circus called life. Don\'t sit in the crowd watchin\' it happen. You jump right in and be the ringleader. That\'s where you find your fire. "" \n ""What if your fire died with someone else?"" \n She shakes her head. ""Nope. Here\'s the thing about life, boy. We meet a lot of people along this journey. Some of them are sonsabitches and some are special. When you find the special ones you don\'t take a moment for granted, because you never know when your time with them is gonna be up. . . . \n As Gus is trying to pick up the pieces of his life again, he comes across Scout. Whom at first annoys him, but then turns into the one person who gets under his skin forcing him to move forward. \n That\'s what makes him so special. It\'s not his talent or his looks. It\'s how much he feels. \n Scout has her own issues, but between the two of them they help each other and bring out the best in one another. \n ""I mean, I think people find each other when they\'re ready for them. When they need each other the most. And it\'s in that time of need that the strongest relationships are formed."" \n It\'s a tough transition, loving one person all your life and to never have them again, while opening up to someone new. Someone who can be a future. It\'s scary for them but so worth the journey. \n She knows how much I loved Bright Side, but she also knows that doesn\'t take away from the love I feel for her. My heart\'s big enough for both of them. Bright side helped make me the man I am, and Scout helped me remember who that man was, helping me become my own person. I love her so much. \n Gus, had a long way to go to find himself again, but what a beautiful journey it was. It was heartbreaking, beautiful and perfect. Bright Side and Gus are books that you need to experience on your own to truly understand the emotions that come with these books. \n I\'ve come to the full realization that my happiness, my life, falls squarely on my shoulders. No one\'s gonna do it for me. I\'m the one who makes it or breaks it. \n It\'s a choice. \n I absolutely LOVE the way Kim Holden writes and how she portrays emotions \n in first Bright Side and then continued with Gus. Even thought my \n heart hurt for weeks after these two books I was happy to see it come a \n bit full circle in this epic journey. \n Bright Side and Gus are books that hold a special place in your heart and will be read over and over and over again. I LOVED them. They are by far one of my favorite books. I wear my Bright side & Gus shirts with pride to help share the state of mind the awesomeness that are these books. \n I so hope there is more from the series. If not I would be content as it was beautiful and perfect and could be left as is, but I would love to see some more HEAs from Pax and from Keller, as well as the rest of the band. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter'",4.5,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23389993-gus,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430743077m/23389993.jpg,42947815,"Gus (Bright Side, #2)",Romance,my heart still hurt star i don t even know how to function anymore bright side wasn t only my best friend she wa like my other half the other half of my brain the other half of my conscience the other half of my sense of humor the other half of my creativity the other half of my heart how do you go back to doing what you did before when half of you is gone forever after bright side i immediately started to read gu which wa a gift and a curse it wa a curse because my heart hurt so much after bright side that i should have given it a bit of rest before diving back in however it s also a gift because gu help to ease the heart in the end after the loss of bright side gu is devastated and is floundering through life with no reason to really live and carry forward he s going through the motion for the band but not really experiencing anything gustov you re stalling you re wasting time you re not living you re not doing what you love god poor gu my heart broke along with him while he tried to find his bearing again have you ever been in love he hasn t blinked once how long did last looking back up to the sky he answer twenty one year and three day dude my heart hurt for gu listen to me boy you only get one chance at this circus called life don t sit in the crowd watchin it happen you jump right in and be the ringleader that s where you find your fire what if your fire died with someone else she shake her head nope here s the thing about life boy we meet a lot of people along this journey some of them are sonsabitches and some are special when you find the special one you don t take a moment for granted because you never know when your time with them is gonna be up a gu is trying to pick up the piece of his life again he come across scout whom at first annoys him but then turn into the one person who get under his skin forcing him to move forward that s what make him so special it s not his talent or his look it s how much he feel scout ha her own issue but between the two of them they help each other and bring out the best in one another i mean i think people find each other when they re ready for them when they need each other the most and it s in that time of need that the strongest relationship are formed it s a tough transition loving one person all your life and to never have them again while opening up to someone new someone who can be a future it s scary for them but so worth the journey she know how much i loved bright side but she also know that doesn t take away from the love i feel for her my heart s big enough for both of them bright side helped make me the man i am and scout helped me remember who that man wa helping me become my own person i love her so much gu had a long way to go to find himself again but what a beautiful journey it wa it wa heartbreaking beautiful and perfect bright side and gu are book that you need to experience on your own to truly understand the emotion that come with these book i ve come to the full realization that my happiness my life fall squarely on my shoulder no one s gonna do it for me i m the one who make it or break it it s a choice i absolutely love the way kim holden writes and how she portrays emotion in first bright side and then continued with gu even thought my heart hurt for week after these two book i wa happy to see it come a bit full circle in this epic journey bright side and gu are book that hold a special place in your heart and will be read over and over and over again i loved them they are by far one of my favorite book i wear my bright side gu shirt with pride to help share the state of mind the awesomeness that are these book i so hope there is more from the series if not i would be content a it wa beautiful and perfect and could be left a is but i would love to see some more heas from pax and from keller a well a the rest of the band for more review visit live read and breathe like u on facebook live read and breathe facebook follow along with twitter live read and breathe twitter,0.9996

If you haven\'t read that yet, I suggest you stop reading this review, read the review I wrote for Bright Side, and get yourself a copy of Bright Side - because this review is going to have major spoilers. \n Gus is a twenty-something rocker dude who is trying to get over the loss of his best friend, Bright Side. Some people seek therapy to cope with loss, while Gus self-medicates with a lot of alcohol, cigarettes, and briefly uses cocaine. On tour with very little else to calm him, these three things, combined with meaningless sex, seems to do the trick...or at least masks the pain for a while. Unbeknownst to Gus, his behavior has made it possible for Scout to obtain much-needed employment...as Gus\' babysitter. Scout, or as he refers to her, ""Impatient"", is getting over something also - and in this darkness, they come to find the light in each other. \n Why didn\'t I give this five stars? \n Although I absolutely loved Bright Side, I found that there were a few things in this story that bothered me: \n 1. Although Gus has an addictive personality (he uses alcohol & cigarettes heavily), Gus begins using cocaine...but surprisingly, stops almost instantly. It is really hard to believe that someone with an addictive personality would be able to give such an addictive drug up so quickly. It seemed as though he had a harder time giving up nicotine than he did cocaine. \n 2. We are introduced to someone who has caused Scout pain in the past - but it didn\'t seem like there was closure to this negative relationship. Yes, restraining orders were filed - but that isn\'t a ""magic fix-all"" and the accused usually comes back for more. This guy didn\'t at all, which seemed unrealistic to me, especially with how he pursued the relationship initially. \n 3. At one point in the book, it was mentioned that Scout doesn\'t like making eye-contact. But then in another, it is mentioned that she communicates non-verbally with Gus through eye-contact. I found this inconsistent because when someone is hesitant to make eye-contact, they won\'t suddenly make it part of their communication pattern. Maybe every once in a while, but not constantly, and not with someone they clearly don\'t like very much. \n What did I like about it? \n 1. I enjoyed the organic development of the relationship between Gus and Scout. I don\'t like when characters develop relationships instantly - and Gus and Scout seemed to realistically fall in love. \n 2. I liked the re-introduction of characters from Bright Side. It has been a while since I read the first book and reminding me of the characters and who they are was helpful. \n 3. The writing was beautiful and the editing was well-done. \n 4. The way Holden describes the relationship between Gus and Bright Side - and Gus\' feelings about his loss was really beautiful and heartbreaking. \n 5. I loved the relationship between Gus and his mother. It was really lovely. \n I know there is more to what I loved about this story and I am sure there is more that you\'ll love, too! \n Take care & happy reading!'",4.5,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23389993-gus,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430743077m/23389993.jpg,42947815,"Gus (Bright Side, #2)",Romance,this story is a follow up to bright side which wa an amazing read if you haven t read that yet i suggest you stop reading this review read the review i wrote for bright side and get yourself a copy of bright side because this review is going to have major spoiler gu is a twenty something rocker dude who is trying to get over the loss of his best friend bright side some people seek therapy to cope with loss while gu self medicates with a lot of alcohol cigarette and briefly us cocaine on tour with very little else to calm him these three thing combined with meaningless sex seems to do the trick or at least mask the pain for a while unbeknownst to gu his behavior ha made it possible for scout to obtain much needed employment a gu babysitter scout or a he refers to her impatient is getting over something also and in this darkness they come to find the light in each other why didn t i give this five star although i absolutely loved bright side i found that there were a few thing in this story that bothered me although gu ha an addictive personality he us alcohol cigarette heavily gu begin using cocaine but surprisingly stop almost instantly it is really hard to believe that someone with an addictive personality would be able to give such an addictive drug up so quickly it seemed a though he had a harder time giving up nicotine than he did cocaine we are introduced to someone who ha caused scout pain in the past but it didn t seem like there wa closure to this negative relationship yes restraining order were filed but that isn t a magic fix all and the accused usually come back for more this guy didn t at all which seemed unrealistic to me especially with how he pursued the relationship initially at one point in the book it wa mentioned that scout doesn t like making eye contact but then in another it is mentioned that she communicates non verbally with gu through eye contact i found this inconsistent because when someone is hesitant to make eye contact they won t suddenly make it part of their communication pattern maybe every once in a while but not constantly and not with someone they clearly don t like very much what did i like about it i enjoyed the organic development of the relationship between gu and scout i don t like when character develop relationship instantly and gu and scout seemed to realistically fall in love i liked the re introduction of character from bright side it ha been a while since i read the first book and reminding me of the character and who they are wa helpful the writing wa beautiful and the editing wa well done the way holden describes the relationship between gu and bright side and gu feeling about his loss wa really beautiful and heartbreaking i loved the relationship between gu and his mother it wa really lovely i know there is more to what i loved about this story and i am sure there is more that you ll love too take care happy reading,0.9985

It will give you everything and more, I'm telling you, I am very happy with how this book unfolded and ended for me its was the best way for Kim to help us readers to move on and ultimately again to question ourselves. To think and then to understand who Gus really is. It still has emotional moments but its not gut wrenching just happiness for me anyway. This book was heart warming had moments that included Kate and all that surrounded her but above all it's a story about family and friendship. \n So What's it about \n So if you've read Bright Side you know that Gus lost his other half his best friend and the love of his life . Hence the reckless way he is living life on the road AT ALL he's away from home and he's away from his Ma and is grieving over his other half The first 1/4 I would say is the hardest to read because Gus isn't his usually happy go lucky self, he's going down the path of self destruction which included booze, drugs and women. That's what his life pretty much entailed. Drowning his sorrows and Running away from his problems and those aspects just were there to stop him remembering about HER. \n But then things change and he meets Scout she's there to be his 'Babysitter' because the band and organisers of the Tour can't handle him anymore . He gets someone to deal with him and everything that he needs, unlucky for both sides they both aren't greatly happy about the job. \n Scout is a quiet nonsense kind of gal, she doesn't take shit from Gus , and at the same time doesn't get too involved with him. She has her own issues she's dealing with and needs this job opportunity so she is basically there to help but not to feel. Saying that Gus has a way to help her even if he doesn't want to, Scout at the beginning I would say is a buffer that helps Gus to breathe a little easier she's a deterrent in his darkness and that just helps him gradually to start to live again. \n Even though they both don't want to be around each other greatly there were some funny moments. Things I enjoyed about this part was Gus's dry sense of humour and likewise how Scout mothered him to you know 'Have a shower' or when your clothes don't move It's time to wash them.... it's time \n Sometimes you meet people and you know the meeting wasn't chance. That they need you or you need them, sometimes both. \n Over time they both start to see a different side to each other and that alone opens up there friendship, it helps them both breathe. It helps them to see how to live again. Then when the Tour ends Scout gets a position working with Gus's Ma and in that they both continue to see each other daily. Scout starts to see who Gus really is in the comfort of his home; the bubbly happy go lucky guy . he is the Gus who puts himself last in every obstacle and always one step ahead in being there for everyone around him, he's the Jedi of friendship you just can't help but fall for his character and who is resembles. \n Kim deliver's another heart warming story that seeps into your pours and gradually see the family theme in this story. There are a few new characters to enjoy too.... \n Characters that make him start to believe in himself, characters where I would say bright Side put there for him on purpose. \n Kim has a way with words that make you as a reader FEELIn the quiet moments I really did see what Kim was doing as I read his story, this wasn't just a romance but a book on new beginnings and life. Gus learned how to be himself again and even more so he learnt how to give freely to the people around him who needed him and who plainly just wanted him to be there and around them because his nature was just an all around existence of love. \n I'm not going to say anything else other than this book is Deep, Hard, Intense, Emotional and then Loving, Honest, and Heart Warming. This is a book of LOVE and honest to God this book has all the FEELS people just need to give these characters a chance, I know some don't like NA reads for immaturity and the age limits of the characters but this book is about Family and living its a story about learning how to live, how to continue and how to move forward. But above all this book is Simplicity Kims books to talk to my heart in a way that speaks volumes, it touched me in ways I can't express but this book is an EXPERIENCE that everyone needs to try whatever age you are (Just my opinion though). \n The Music \n Again the music was apart of the story as much as the words were it was the life of the book so I'd highly recommend you listening some of these tracks as you read the book. \n I Hope You Suffer ~ AFI \n I Need My Girl ~ The National \n Cope ~ Manchester Orchestra \n Me ~ The 1975 \n Killing You ~ Broods \n Figure It Out ~ Royal Blood \n The Scientist ~ Coldplay \n Homesick ~ Catfish and the Bottlemen \n Baby Please Don't Leave me ~ Buddy Guy \n Love Me Like You Used To ~ You Ask Me At Six \n Giants ~ Bear Hands \n All Around me ~ Flyleaf \n Tiny Raindrop ~ Balance and Composure \n Fall into the Party ~ Twin Atlantic \n Kiss Me ~ Ed Sheeran \n This book was written for the READERS so READ IT!!!! \n That.

If you have not read the first two please be cautious of this review as their will be spoilers for the first two books. \n Brad's fail safe solution of protecting Julia is with an engagement. At the end of book 2, I was thinking this engagement was out of love but I had a nagging feeling that it was only for her safety and I was concerned that Brad was going to go back to his man whore ways but Brad surprised me in this book. \n Right from the beginning we get to realize that Brad is really all in with this relationship. He truly loves Julia. Throughout this book we get to feel and experience the depth of Brad's emotions and love towards Julia. \n Julia loves Brad but she also wants some independence so she conforms to some notions but puts her foot down in others. She is fierce when it comes to Brad even when it comes to his family, her family, or her friends. \n As the wedding gets closer temptations and pasts rear their ugly head. Julia's ex-fiance tries to make a dent into her plans but with his appearance it only solidifies her feelings for Brad. As Brad is trying to turn a new leaf he gifts Julia the strip club causing them to crash head on to Brad's past and potential weakness. \n As my heart started to get palpitations wondering what Brad was going to do with temptation and I wanted to bitch slap Alexis with her antics causing me so much grief then Brad surprises Alexis and me. \n Things are going as smooth as can be then be in the world of Brad and Julia they still find time to explore sexually, while they prepare for their wedding, evade bitchy friends and trying families. \n Just when we think we are going to get our HEA the rug gets pulled under our feet. As Brad's world falls apart Julia fighting spirit comes to the forefront. However, not to spoil to much but we do get our HEA in the end. \n I really did enjoy this series. It had so many different facets going on while a beautiful love story was blossoming. I loved the growth and depth of Brad. One of my weaknesses are man whores who succumb to love. It may not be the norm relationship, but it works for Brad and Julia and in the end that is all that matters. When the pivotal angst was happening in the book I did find that part a bit rushed which caused me to lose a bit of the dimension in that storyline but it didn't effect the whole series experience. \n I am a big fan of Alessandra Torre and if you like Erotica with an edge and a little kink and drama then this is series worth the read. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter""",4.21,"He thought I owned him. He thought he loved me, that I was enough. But this animal, this sex god who could drive me crazy and steal my heart in the same breath, he would never fully be mine. It was impossible.

One year. I have one year to find out more about this man I am marrying. More about his family. More about our sex, and all of the dirty, delicious places it will take me.
I thought I'd spend this year making a decision. I never thought the decision would be taken from me, snatched right from my naive little hands.

This love story has brought us full circle in that this is in 'my book' how Brad has come to realise that he is very much IN-LOVE with Julia, this is how he entwines himself in all that is Julia, how she becomes his best friend, his soul mate how they're engaged and how this year that they're planning their wedding is how they both become a whole unit TOGETHER. \n Sexually they have a somewhat taboo relationship, and in that way this is not a 'normal' love story, I love Alessandra yet again for giving us readers something extra to enjoy, This book was erotic, beautiful and fluent I very much enjoyed the ride. As a couple they love to share themselves with an extra person, and this was an extra dimension their relationship. Saying all that , Brad is starting to feel that he didn't want anyone other than Julia but Julia just wanted to give something extra to Brad, really this has a complete feel in the final instalment, I just felt that as a couple they became Whole together. \n I loved how Julia is feisty as ever and held herself well when confronted by Brads 'bad' mafia father, The whole protecting Julia scenario and Julia fighting strong was just another reason why I loved her and how Brad was her match in heaven they suit each other perfectly . Not only that but I enjoyed how Julia and Brad's life has changed their responsibilities are different, how Julia's friends might hold grudges but Julia became mature in her actions to the whole ordeal. \n That is All......""",4.21,"He thought I owned him.

Literally, I devoured and consumed all three books of the Innocence series plus the Diary of Brad De Luca in three days. I was addicted to Brad De Luca and Julia. I never wanted their story to end and I wanted more. Hands down Ms. Torre's writing is captivating and spellbinding. When I read the last page of the epilogue, it was bittersweet for me. I hate to say goodbye to Brad and Julia. These two are unlike any couple that I have read. Their relationship screams passionate, hot, sexy, understanding, love, and trust. Brad and Julia's relationship is not your typical norm but they are still a committed couple even though they have a sexual preference of menage. What makes this couple stand out is that there is no jealousy...they are simply confident with their relationship. Their love is so strong that not even another person can come between them. They only have eyes for each other. \n End of Innocence picks off where it last left off in Masked Innocence. Julia and Brad are back and PASSIONATE than ever!!! Ms. Torre was able to incorporate sex, love, trust, and suspense all in End of Innocence. Julia's new found sexuality is embraced. Brad finally found the one woman who can satisfy and complete him. Together they are each other's missing piece. All loose ends from Masked Innocence were wrapped up in this final installment. Ms. Torre did not just give us an ordinary predictable love story. She took us on one hell of a sexy rollercoaster ride that I didn't want to get off. End of Innocence concluded in Brad De Luca fashion. Readers are left holding their breath if Brad and Julia can weather any storm that comes their way. Is this lifestyle Julia wants? How strong is their love? Will Julia and Brad get their HEA? \n I loved the transformation and growth of Julia's character..the once naive heroine blossomed into a confident, independent woman who knows her sexuality. Julia is no longer blindfolded but has her eyes wide open. She knows what she loves and that is Brad. She accepts this newfound sexual exploration with open arms. As for Brad, I absolutely love him. He is sexy, confident, and the man knows what he wants. He only has eyes for Julia and she is the only one in his heart. If there ever a couple who was confident in their love, it was Brad and Julia. \n The Innocence series has made me a fan of Alessandra Torre. Her writing is flawless, brilliant, and spellbinding. She has a way to hypnotize her readers with every word. I find myself losing track of time because I am devouring her books in one sitting. Her writing is original. Her characters are real. Emotions expressed are raw and heartfelt. Passion and intimacy was felt. Alessandra Torre did an amazing job in developing Brad and Julia's relationship. It was fun, honest, sexy, passionate, fierce, and steaming hot. Brad is unlike any male hero...his presence in the book will make any readers sigh and swoon over him. Ms. Torre will amaze and captivate you with the Innocence series. She was able to conclude the story that left me smiling. So if you haven't read the Innocence series, what are you waiting for? Go meet Brad De Luca.. Like an addict who needs their fix, the Innocence series was what I craved. \n Alessandra Torre \n *** Reviews on Behalf of Give Me Books***""",4.21,"He thought I owned him.

It was different with an air of mystery and suspense in the background but still had a great love story. \n Here we have Dahlia who has lived through a lot of sadness and loss but one constant she always had was Ben who also happened to be the love of her life. With Ben they have a huge once in a lifetime love being friends since they were kids growing into lovers and on their way to getting married....then the unthinkable happens and she has to live through another HUGE loss. \n When Dahlia was still with Ben, she had a girls night out and during this night out with her best friend she meets a singer named River from a band who she is instantly drawn too but she does the right thing and goes back to her boyfriend and pushes thoughts of this singer to the back of her mind. \n ""...All I know is, I was a young college girl who flirted with an insanely attractive guy at a bar and had to leave because she felt like the cosmic universe had crashed down on her. And she couldn\'t accept that; she had a boyfriend."" \n Dahlia is having a hard time with the loss of Ben but with time and the support of her friends she is able to finally move on and start living again. Her first real step out into the world she runs right back into River from years gone past and their connection is as strong as ever. \n River and Dahlia make up for lost time and their connection does nothing but grow and cements the two of them together. Dahlia has a hard time with this since these feelings are so new, different and stronger than she had with Ben but since Ben is gone she has to let go and move forward with River. \n Now this love story is all and good and I adore it but the awesome part through the whole book is the undercurrents of secrets that you know are going to cause a world of shit for these two. There are so many elements that are going to be pulled together I assume in the next few books that can either strengthen or break River and Dahlia. But let me tell you that epilogue HOLY SHIT!!! SO was not what I expected but I LOVED that twist and I can NOT WAIT to read TORN to find out what happens with this new twist and how they play out with all the other undercurrents. \n This books is a must read for me and I can\'t wait to read more from the series. \n For more reviews, visit Live Read and Breathe \n Like us on Facebook Live Read and Breathe Facebook \n Follow along with Twitter Live Read and Breathe Twitter'",4.11,"What if a 'Once in a Lifetime' could happen twice?
Suffering from a past full of tragedy, Dahlia London's soul has been left completely shattered. Happily ever after is a far cry from reality in her world. But, when she is reconnected with her past, the bonds that form are irrefutable.
When River Wilde, lead singer of The Wilde Ones, comes back into Dahlia's life, the intensity that fires their relationship combined with underlying feelings that have never died lead her to believe she has met her soulmate.
Struggling with confusion as old connections fade and new ones begin, Dahlia's grief begins to lift--but guilt remains. River wants to be the one to mend all that is torn within her.
But with a past that is never really gone, can their future survive?",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17902302-connected,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1368031865m/17902302.jpg,22380673,"Connected (Connections, #1)",Romance,source earc for honest review from penguin via netgalley finally i have been in a reading funk lately with being bombarded with similar plot formula and story line but this little number shook me out of it it wa different with an air of mystery and suspense in the background but still had a great love story here we have dahlia who ha lived through a lot of sadness and loss but one constant she always had wa ben who also happened to be the love of her life with ben they have a huge once in a lifetime love being friend since they were kid growing into lover and on their way to getting married then the unthinkable happens and she ha to live through another huge loss when dahlia wa still with ben she had a girl night out and during this night out with her best friend she meet a singer named river from a band who she is instantly drawn too but she doe the right thing and go back to her boyfriend and push thought of this singer to the back of her mind all i know is i wa a young college girl who flirted with an insanely attractive guy at a bar and had to leave because she felt like the cosmic universe had crashed down on her and she couldn t accept that she had a boyfriend dahlia is having a hard time with the loss of ben but with time and the support of her friend she is able to finally move on and start living again her first real step out into the world she run right back into river from year gone past and their connection is a strong a ever river and dahlia make up for lost time and their connection doe nothing but grow and cement the two of them together dahlia ha a hard time with this since these feeling are so new different and stronger than she had with ben but since ben is gone she ha to let go and move forward with river now this love story is all and good and i adore it but the awesome part through the whole book is the undercurrent of secret that you know are going to cause a world of shit for these two there are so many element that are going to be pulled together i assume in the next few book that can either strengthen or break river and dahlia but let me tell you that epilogue holy shit so wa not what i expected but i loved that twist and i can not wait to read torn to find out what happens with this new twist and how they play out with all the other undercurrent this book is a must read for me and i can t wait to read more from the series for more review visit live read and breathe like u on facebook live read and breathe facebook follow along with twitter live read and breathe twitter,0.9987

It's only when he discovers there is a man in a clown costume following him that he panics. Soon, it turns out his cackling shadow isn't the only circus freak hiding in the dark, but what does a bunch of crazy clowns do when they catch you?

To say I was taken with it would be an understatement. Not only did it inspire my first attempt at fan fiction, but I also tore the full-page picture of the main couple out of the magazine, framed it, and hung it on my wall of my room. \n That picture remained there long after I left home, and as my own life turned out less novel-perfect than I'd dreamed, on each visit home I was seized with the notion that if I could just identify the book that picture came from and reread it, perhaps I could recapture some of that romantic idealism I had as a 13-year-old. After years of thinking this, I finally took the picture out of the frame and brought it home with me on the plane, where I got enough clues from the writing on the back of the page to identify it as this novel and find it at a library near me. \n I was as taken with the story as I had been the first time. The main character, Miriam, is someone I can really identify with, managing to be entirely practical while still keeping her eyes open for possibilities of adventure and romance. In seeking to solve the mystery of her parents' early lives, she travels to Maine and sensibly goes about investigating things, while managing to fall in love with a great guy at the same time. I would tell you whether I liked the ending of the book, but I didn't actually finish it. Believe it or not, during the time I had this book out from the library, I met the man who would eventually become my husband, and he swept me off my feet to such an extent that I returned the book to the library without finishing it! So perhaps the feeling I always got from that picture was correct after all.""",4.25,"At 27, Miriam Gould leads a life a good many people would envy. She is a successful editor of books for young people at a New York publishing house. She has her own apartment with a wood-burning fireplace. She has the delightful Mike Andric eager to marry her.
Not so enviable is the overwhelming sense of loss and loneliness she carries with her. Every year as April comes closer, she is subject increasingly to exhausting valleys of depression.
She was brought up in Connecticut by her mother, who told her matter-of-factly when she was 12 that she had never married Miriam's father and that he had been killed in the war. With this brief recital, her mother considers the subject closed. Miriam only knows that the two grew up together in a small town in Maine. Throughout her adolescence she fixes on one hero after another and dreams that her father must have looked like them. When Miriam is 21 her mother dies in a bus accident. Much later, the young woman musters the courage to go through her mother's few personal possessions. They include her photograph albums, which Miriam had pored over as a child. They also include a few pieces of jewelry. When Miriam goes through them, she finds that the jewel box's moire bottom is a false one. Under it are three long letters, the last written to her mother shortly before her death. All are signed ""Fern"". A photograph in one of the albums shows a child named Fern in a clown suit.
The letters are postmarked ""Parmenter, Maine"". An opportunity comes for Miriam to spend an extended period of time editing a manuscript away from her office. A fragment of poetry underlined in one of her mother's books... ""Where the lost Aprils are, and the lost Mays..."" haunts Miriam, and she heads for Parmenter to do her editorial work and to find her mother's lost Aprils.
At Parmenter, in exorcising her own ghosts, she finds a good deal more, including arson and mayhem, in the suspenseful Ogilvie tradition.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1856090.Where_The_Lost_Aprils_Are,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1258848622m/1856090.jpg,1856690,Where The Lost Aprils Are,Romance,i first read this book a a young teenager in an old issue of good housekeeping where it had appeared in condensed form to say i wa taken with it would be an understatement not only did it inspire my first attempt at fan fiction but i also tore the full page picture of the main couple out of the magazine framed it and hung it on my wall of my room that picture remained there long after i left home and a my own life turned out le novel perfect than i d dreamed on each visit home i wa seized with the notion that if i could just identify the book that picture came from and reread it perhaps i could recapture some of that romantic idealism i had a a year old after year of thinking this i finally took the picture out of the frame and brought it home with me on the plane where i got enough clue from the writing on the back of the page to identify it a this novel and find it at a library near me i wa a taken with the story a i had been the first time the main character miriam is someone i can really identify with managing to be entirely practical while still keeping her eye open for possibility of adventure and romance in seeking to solve the mystery of her parent early life she travel to maine and sensibly go about investigating thing while managing to fall in love with a great guy at the same time i would tell you whether i liked the ending of the book but i didn t actually finish it believe it or not during the time i had this book out from the library i met the man who would eventually become my husband and he swept me off my foot to such an extent that i returned the book to the library without finishing it so perhaps the feeling i always got from that picture wa correct after all,0.9945

Not only do we get Hogan and Violet's story, we also are treated to Nathan and Brooklin. There is even a little side romance where Colt finds some happiness as well. At first, I was hoping for Nathan to get his own story. I wasn't sure I would like both romances in one book. But both couples' stories were woven together so well that it really worked for me in the end. \n Hogan has a lot of baggage from his late wife and for a time was not the nicest guy to women except get them in bed. Violet is fiercely independent and has worked hard for everything she has, including the diner. Between Hogan and Violet, the attraction is there, but they have a ways to go before they can trust each other. I was really rooting for them. I loved Hogan in the first book. He just seemed so lost and deserving of a good woman in his life. \n Nathan is smitten from the beginning. He has a tough job cracking the walls around Brooklin. But she is harboring a secret, so her reasons for keeping to herself are valid. I'll let you read it to find out her secret. There does end up being a little mystery and the scene toward the end was pretty intense. \n I highly recommend this book as well as the first one, Don't Tempt Me.

Luke will stop at nothing to win her back. \n ""Do you know how much I missed you?"" he asked me as we swayed to one of the slower songs. \n I buried my face in his neck to hide my tears. ""Then why did you leave?"" My voice broke at the end of the sentence, and Luke ran his fingers through my hair in a calming gesture. \n ""Because I was stupid,"" he stated matter of factly. ""I loved you so damn much, but I thought I was no good for you. I really did think I was doing the right thing for you, Emmy."" \n ""I don\'t care if you can\'t stand the sight of me. I don\'t care if you hate me until the day you die. I\'ll always be your Luke."" \n I loved, loved, loved this book! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. The characters are amazing. Emerson is so strong, sweet and fierce. She takes no one shit and can dish it right back. Her friends, especially Savannah are amazing. Savannah had me laughing so hard at times with her crazy banter with Luke. She is fiercely protective of Emmy and will stop at nothing to keep it that way. The rest of their friends (Brett, Stacia, Jeremy, Gavin and her newest friend Trevor, who happens to be Luke\'s best friend) create the family that she needs, lending her all the support that a family can give. \n I loved Luke and his determination to right all the wrongs that he created by severing ties with all his friends. And the relationship that he starts to rebuild with his mom, who spent most of his life with a bottle stuck to her mouth, not caring what went on in her home, making Luke\'s life extremely miserable. \n Picking Up the Pieces is a bitter sweet story about love, loss, regret, determination, hope and above all forgiveness. I am so excited to read the second book in this series. Jessica does a wonderful job creating a story that draws you in and makes you want to hang on for the entire roller coaster ride of emotions. If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would. One of my top 10 favorite reads so far in 2013.'",3.95,"After having her heart broken by the only man she's ever loved everything seemed to go downhill for Emerson Grace.

It's a special occurrence to be able to say something such as that! This was a fantastic read and I can't wait for you to venture it on your own! \n This is a very promising debut novel that is based highly off the authors own awe-inspiring, cross-country adventure at a young age. \n I was so amazingly wrapped up in this story that I just HAD to stay up last and finish it. The chemistry between the characters is undeniable and genuine; it's easy to lose yourself with the time they share together, almost as if you were there. Angeli is a tremendously brave -despite her unknowing of it-- to take on the long road ahead of her alone. With each cherished friend she meets up with, she is trialed with many different choices to make, and finds pieces of herself along the way. \n Each character you meet in this story has their own problems they face and have to deal with. I feel that not only with just Angeli, readers could relate to, but there is a character in here that everyone might feel a tad of a connection with. Angeli has witnessed so much. That connection is hard to come by in books, and I feel it is a very important bond between reader and character/author. \n Angeli faces a lot of her own struggles before the journey and as it takes place. \n The stress she undergoes, as well, and how she comes out stronger in the end is inspiring for anyone who just needs that little push to get up and follow their own dreams-- to live a little. \n I love how each chapter ends with a mileage log and a page from her diary for each day, filled with important revelations and the emotions she experienced. Experiences such as being detained on the Canadian border, Ground Zero in NYC, the struggles with two boys who claim their love for her, endless! All in all, she sees that there are others out there who suffer much worse things than her in their lives, the different ways people live and their cultures. She escapes danger, and goodness, just exciting to live vicariously through these pages. I wish I could have gone through with making a trip like this. My best friend growing up and I would mention it in passing but plans just never fell through. What a great learning experience this must have been for the author. This story absolutely proves that life is what you make it. \n In the epilogue of this story, she states that she will never know exactly who she is, or what may become of her career-- if she ever decides one at all... Well, let me just offer this, she has nothing to worry about. Her unique and refreshing storytelling is going to get her far, very far and I am excited that we were able to witness the debut of a long and beautiful career ahead of her. And I am sure that after the readers finally get their hands on this coming of age novel, that they too will agree. =) !""",3.7,"Eighteen-year-old Angeli doesn't ""fit in."" She's never been on a single date, and she lives vicariously through an online world of storytelling. With the pressures of choosing a practical future path bearing down, she needs a drastic change. Too old to run away from home, she opts instead to embark on a solo 2-month road trip. But her freedom is tempered by loneliness -- and anxiety tests her resolve as she comes face-to-face with her quirky internet friends.
Aside from contracting mono and repeatedly getting herself lost, Angeli's adventure is mired by more unforeseen glitches -- like being detained by Canadian authorities, and a near-death experience at the hands of an overzealous amateur wrestler. Her odyssey is complicated further when she unwittingly earns the affections of two young men. One a privileged martial artist; the other a talented techie with a colorful past.
Bewildered by the emotions they stir, Angeli spurns the idea of a doomed long-distance relationship. But she is unprepared for the determination of her hopeful suitors. In the wake of her refusal, one man will betray her, and the other will prove himself worthy of a place in her future.
Angeli sets off in search of a better understanding of herself, the world, and her place in it. What she finds is an impractical love, with the potential to restore her faith in happy endings.

I felt like I was apart of every stop and be very venture. Angie has done something not many people including myself are brave enough to do. I've always imagined taking an Eat, Pray, Love approach to life and just traveling the world. Although Angie didn't exactly leave the United States she traveled farther than she ever did and learned valuable lessons along the way. \n I felt myself growing in bravery and faith with every stop. This is a kind of book where you began questioning things, wondering if you're meant for more, if you're living life to its fullest and more. I think what made the story so unique besides whom she went to meet on her trip was how realistic the story was. It felt more like a biography than fiction. \n I liked the way it was written including the journal entries, that made for a realistic reading experience. I wish she was a little less hard on herself but I guess that's apart of learning and growing. \n I loved the journey and I'm glad I seen it through to the end. I loved the ending as well, my little romantic heart swooned. \n This book is great for any reader or any age.

I knew Ghost's story would be hard to take but the picture that was painted of his past was almost like a physical pain. Nat is so very different from BFF Tina, and seemed to internalize her hurt and lash out. She is also, admittedly, very selfish and self-centered. BUT water always seeks its own level. My take is that these two characters were dealing with a level of hurt and they could only dish it out to each other. As they knew they were the only one's in their lives who could take it. The transformation from Ghost to Asher was well done, and his immediate understanding of Cole made that entire arc very difficult to read. The humor and the rest of the gang return to watch Nat and Ghost/Ash take each other on and I was a fan of it!!

Something strange is happening up the mountain and Viktor, Navy SEAL, is going to find out exactly what it is and why his nephew ended up in a coma in hospital. His family is at risk and he will do everything and anything to protect them. \n It is a romance, a story of second and third chances. Viktor and Aiden (who is now working in law enforcement) knew each other in high school, where Aiden had long term expectations. Years later when they reconnect, he still loves Viktor. But Viktor is a man haunted by his belief that as a SEAL he can't offer anything to anyone. He runs. It takes the threat to his family to bring Viktor and Aiden together again as they put their lives at risk to solve the mystery. \n This is a story with lots of drama and action- murder, villains and true hero moments- but also soul searching as Aiden and Viktor fight their attraction to each other. The sex is super hot and the ending fabulous- i just love big moments that make people face the truth! \n I enjoyed the blend of mystery and romance and the pacing of the book. Sure, at moments Viktor annoyed the hell out of me but the happy ending for these heroes was definitely worth it. \n I am now very much looking forward to the second book, Last Marine Standing, due to be released in June, which gives us Sam's story. \n A copy of this book was received from the author with no expectations of a review. \n For m/m romance reviews and more check out Because Two Men Are Better Than One!""",3.77,"When SEAL, Viktor Zavodny, left small town America for the Navy he made sure he never had a reason to return for anything other than visiting family.

Christo's life fell apart when his partner of eight years walked out on him. There wasn't even a reason for it: sometimes love just fades, as quickly and mysteriously as it appears in the first place.

I am always impatient waiting for the next installment and I have read most of them numerous times. Laurann is a polished writer and this series hasnt gotten boring or repetitive after 12 books....which is quite an accomplishment. \n This book isn\'t boring either, but it wasn\'t one of the better stories, imho. \n The good stuff (spoilers ahead) : anything about New Species and life on Reservation or Homeland is good and this has plenty. We got to catch up with some favorite characters and we got to know the kids a bit (which was well written and interesting). Also, Laurann introduced some new characters who seem to have potential for future books (I\'m interested in the story of this new Gift who is afraid of New Species. And Book and Snow and Bluebird need stories. And why was the human swat guy -can\'t think of his name- hanging out on Reservation in the middle of the night? There is a story there). All of the entertaining and endearing elements of the New Species community are alive and well in this book. \n The not-so-good: I think the reason I didn\'t enjoy this book as much as many of the others in the series is because I didn\'t like the main characters. Darkness was not a likable hero and Kat was annoying to me. I get that Darkness is a tortured soul...that was well established in previous books...but that usually opens the possibility for that character to discover happiness on a level that less-tortured characters aren\'t capable of. The reader wants them to find it more because they need it more and when they do, it feels more satisfying to the reader (cue the ""awwwww"" factor that usually comes with this kind of HEA). That didn\'t happen in this book because Darkness never wanted an HEA until the last 20 pages. As a reader it was harder to get invested in wanting something for him he was so actively uninterested in. And once he did get on board, it seemed stiff and forced (he doesn\'t even kiss the heroine until the last 20ish pages and then all of the sudden he\'s telling her he\'s in love. Really? And he passes on contraception at the end to demonstrate his sudden seriousness about their relationship? That isn\'t sweet...that\'s creepy and twisted.) Kat is a strong female (which is great) but she alternates between being angry at Darkness for being such a jerk and instantly forgiving him. She tries to push him into accepting her in his life but when he resists she immediately backs off and acts angry and hurt. I felt like I had whiplash from her mood swings. Maybe it\'s just me, but I get annoyed when female characters hear the male character say he is emotionally unavailable, and then whine and act surprised and wounded when they actually act emotionally unavailable. Surprise surprise. \n In a nutshell: This is a New Species book, so it\'s good. But it isn\'t one of the better offerings in the series. I probably won\'t read this one again. But I will impatiently wait for the next one because Laurann knows what she is doing.'",4.28,"Kat's boss wants dirt on the NSO.

His legs shifted under her as he used them to brace the bike, before turning off the engine. \n ""You can get up now."" \n Beth clenched her teeth. ""Thanks for the suicide ride."" She released his jacket and tried to gracefully climb off his lap. She tried to lift up but her ass was trapped between his thighs. She had to grip his arm and pull up. Her skirt rose dangerously close to exposing her panties where it snagged against his jeans but she had to keep hold of her purse, rather than grab to tug it down. \n A big gloved hand slid under her ass and gave her a push. She gasped but then slid until her bare feet touched pavement. She wobbled for a second, released him, and shoved at her skirt to push it back down into place. \n ""Thanks."" She hoped he understood the sarcastic tone. \n ""No problem."" \n He climbed off the bike after putting down the kickstand. She turned, gaping a little since he seemed even bigger on his feet. He had to be over six foot two and his unfolded body held a lot of bulk. He reached up and tore off his helmet. \n Beth was stunned when she took in his features. She\'d been around enough New Species to identify them. He was a canine with shaggy brown hair that was in need of a cut. Intense brown eyes fixed on her. He had some seriously long, thick eyelashes. She sucked in a breath, impressed a little by how handsome he was. His full lips twisted into a frown though, making him look a little mean. \n He stepped into her personal space and lowered his head. She held her breath, wondering if he was going to kiss her. Her heart sped up. She wouldn\'t have minded. His gaze seemed to search her eyes as he kept inches from her. \n ""You thought I was human. You look surprised. Aren\'t you afraid of me?"" \n The softer tone he used was kind of sexy. ""No. Your driving is another story though. I still stand by what I said. Whoever gave you a license should be fired."" \n The corners of his mouth lifted into a smile. ""Who says I have one?"" \n She hadn\'t expected that response. \n He straightened and stepped back. ""They are waiting for us inside. I\'m Harley."" \n VEN!! \n ""This way,"" a man shouted. ""I see her. This way, damn it. Cut the bitch off."" \n She had a straight away with no trees in her path. She turned her head. She saw four of them and they were spread out and advancing on her. Tom was one of them, spotting his blond hair. Terror made her fight through the pain in her feet and the now aching sides she had from running. She managed a little more speed. \n She saw something ahead of her and it moved. Shit. Had Tom brought more of his friends to terrorize her? She knew she was close to the NSO even though she couldn\'t see it yet. The trees were too dense. The wall was a good thirty feet high. If she could reach it and if the New Species guard was there patrolling he could hold the men off of her with one of the guns they always carried. \n She didn\'t see a branch but felt it hit her ankle hard. She screamed out as she was propelled into the ground. She hit grass on her stomach. She felt pain in her hip. She clawed the grass and pulled herself up, managing to stumble to her feet. The sounds of the pursuing men were a lot closer. She could hear their heavy breathing over her own. Her terror spiked higher and she started to run. \n She dodged a tree and saw something suddenly in her path. She gasped, too winded to be able to scream, as her body slammed into a larger, hard body. She thought they\'d both go down but the man she hit took the impact of her running body. He just grunted and arms wrapped around her that locked her to him. \n Cassie\'s head jerked up. The man was bald, really tall, and muscular. His shirtless chest was barreled and his arms were massive. His eyes were icey blue and she knew instantly she was in a ton of shit. He frowned down at her, locking her in the cage of his arms against his chest. He jerked his head up and his nose flared. A deep growl tore from his parted mouth. \n Cassie was shocked when he suddenly spun, yanking her off of her feet. Her back pressed against a tree he\'d been behind and the arms and body pinning her were suddenly gone. \n ""Stay,"" he snarled. \n He wasn\'t fully human. She got that and felt relief. He was New Species. She stared up at his wide, tan back. She was shocked. She\'d never seen a New Species without hair before. They all usually had at least shoulder length hair or a lot longer. She saw his muscles bulge when his entire body tensed and he threw back his head. A howl tore from his throat that sent terror right down her spine. It was a loud, frightening sound, and she would have sworn it had come from a wolf instead of a man. \n Seconds later another howl echoed through the woods. The man in front of her chuckled. He turned his head and then a low, deep growl came from his throat. It terrified Cassie. The man suddenly moved and she saw what had caused his anger. \n One of the men with Tom came bursting between the thick trees. The bald man was suddenly on the man. He jumped on the shocked man in the blink of an eye and took him down. The bald man gripped the man\'s neck as they went down and twisted hard. A horrible and deadly crack followed. The man in camouflage dropped to the ground lifelessly. Cassie stared. She saw his neck twisted at a wrong angle and his eyes were sightlessly staring at nothing. He was dead. \n A soft sound pushed from her throat and she found herself hugging the tree at her back by grabbing it with her hands. The bald man was on his feet in a heartbeat and a vicious snarl burst from his parted lips. It was loud. Movement made Cassie jerk her head. \n Another man ran out and saw the bald man. This one had time to utter a soft scream before the bald man lunged at him. The bald man kicked the other man in the throat, falling him like a tree. He just dropped straight back where he was thrown. He didn\'t move. \n Another howl tore from the woods and a second later it sounded as if a lion roared. It was loud and close. Cassie dug her fingernails into the bark of the tree. Her focus locked on the bald man. \n He sniffed the area and his gaze scanned the woods around them. He moved toward her, never looking at her once. He moved closer and turned, putting his back to her just inches away. \n She understood what he did even though he didn\'t speak to her. She was backed into a large tree where he protected her. He had put his body and that tree between her and anyone who wanted to hurt her. \n A male high pitched scream sounded in the woods close. Cassie\'s heart pounded. She tried to catch her breath even as she saw spots and fought the urge to pass out from fear and exhaustion. \n ""Get away from me, you animal,"" a man yelled, before he screamed. \n The bald man suddenly relaxed. He slowly turned to face Cassie. She stared up at him. He had a thick neck and strong features. She stared into his eyes and realized for the first time that they were oddly shaped. He opened his mouth suddenly and he flashed long, sharp teeth at her. \n ""What is your name?"" He growled the words. \n ""Cassie."" \n He frowned. ""Why are you out here?"" \n ""This is my land. They chased me from my house. Thank you so much. I thought they were going to get their hands on me."" \n He arched an eyebrow. ""Who were they?"" \n Were. She got that word placement. She swallowed. ""They were men who\'ve tried to force me to sell my land to them to stop your people from getting it. I refused to sell to anyone."" \n His eyes had to be the coldest she\'d ever seen. Their color was so unusual that it was probably the reason they appeared frightening. They were a weird blue that was too light and bright to look real. If she didn\'t know better she\'d swear they had to be contacts but she knew they weren\'t. \n His attention lowered slowly down her body. She realized she was just in a pair of bikini blue underwear and a black bra. Her arms instantly rose, covering her breasts. He softly growled at her and his nose flared. He took a step closer. \n Cassie backed up and hit the tree with her butt. He invaded her personal space slowly. She didn\'t like the look on his face one bit. \n ""Stay back,"" she said softly. \n He stopped, freezing just inches from her. His eyes flew to hers. ""You\'re in heat."" \n She blinked at him. ""What?"" \n He softly growled again. ""I want you."" \n She was shocked. ""Well, you can\'t have me. What\'s your name?"" \n Those strange eyes of his locked with hers. ""Vengeance."" \n She swallowed hard. Not a nice name. It implied violence. Great. She was in the woods with a man who\'d just killed to protect her and he wanted her. She knew what he meant and how he meant it. She saw his nose flare again and the look in his eyes as he stared slowly down her body was an easy read. Desire and lust. Her heart started to pound. The guy was huge. Muscular. Half dressed. \n Jericho; \n He released her fast enough that she teetered on her heels but he suddenly bent and she gasped when his shoulder lightly pressed against her middle. She was off her feet and hoisted up before she realized what he intended to do. The word spun as she found herself upside down and being carried through the gates. \n ""Get her bag,"" the man holding her growled. \n She\'d dropped her attache case. It took some head twisting and lifting but she managed to spot it on the ground on the other side of the gate. The first guard cursed loudly but did as he was told. He snatched up her case and followed, slamming and locking the gates behind them. \n ""Please,"" she managed to get out. ""Put me down."" \n A thick arm pressed against the back of her thighs, wedging just under the hem of her skirt. The material of his shirt was a little rough on her bare skin as he clamped onto her in a way that left no doubt her request was denied. \n ""Don\'t fight,"" he ordered. \n She hung there limp, scared, and regretted her decision to come to the NSO for help. A five star hotel may have been able to handle reporters descending on their lobby in mass to keep them away from her. She\'d contacted her accountant to request he close out her bank accounts. Zed had told her it would take about a week but then she\'d be cash flush enough to last her a few months. A call placed to her mother\'s attorney had been grim, him stating a battle over the will could last years. Her uncle planned to use the press as a way to win at any cost when he\'d learned everything had been left to Faith. She\'d tried to warn him of what would really happen but he hadn\'t listened. The NSO would end up getting every dime. \n They entered a building and she frantically glanced around for help. A few uniforms caught her attention but it was impossible to glimpse faces when the person holding her increased his pace. \n ""What is going on, Jericho?"" It was a female who spoke. \n ""I\'m taking her to interrogation room one."" \n ""I\'ll come with. Did you pat her down?"" \n ""No. Call Fury. Tell him the daughter of Doctor Tee is in custody."" \n ""Shit!"" The woman softly hissed and spun, rushing away. \n It took a few more moments and then they entered another room. The world righted as he bent and her ass landed on a hard, flat surface. He braced her back with another arm when he put her down so she remained upright since her balance was off. She realized he\'d purposely been gentle when he\'d sat her on the table since nothing hurt. He released her and took a few steps back. \n Faith glanced around. The room had concrete walls, no windows or mirrors, one camera in the corner, and a metal door. The ceiling was concrete too with a long covered light over the metal table she sat on. Tightly weaved bars covered the fixture to prevent it from being tampered with in any way. No chairs were around the table. Her focus fixed on the big man in the uniform. \n She wasn\'t sure what to say. A hundred questions filled her mind but she wasn\'t sure which one to ask first. It disturbed her that he\'d stated she was in custody. That implied she was under arrest. A new fear popped up and she decided to go with that first. \n ""In custody? I\'m not my mother! You know that, right? Am I under arrest? I didn\'t do anything but come here. \n He reached up and tore off the helmet. Faith was fascinated yet frightened when she got a look at him. His hair was black, pulled back in a ponytail, and his features were very masculine. Strong cheekbones and a chin dominated his face with a set of full lips set in a grimace. His nose drew her attention next. It was wide and flatter than a full human. Her gaze lifted to stare into a pair of startling eyes. They revealed he wasn\'t a feline New Species. They were too rounded and human appearing. The color of them was what made her glad to be sitting. They were a dark brown but there was red hue to them in the harsh overhead light. \n She studied his face again with a quick glance down, before real fear set in once again. She had no doubt of what genetics her mother had used to infuse with his human DNA. The man in front of her was breathing proof of a link between man and ape. Her mother might have formed that connection in his case but it was undeniable. \n A host of history lessons on failed experiments surfaced in her memory from research she\'d done when curiosity had struck about what her mother did for a living. Her focus had been more on the cures geneticist had found but she\'d covered parahuman experiments as well. A documented Soviet biologist had wanted to create an ape/human hybrid but never succeeded. He\'d developed a method for artificially inseminating domestic animals but her mother had actually taken it to a new level by using genetic engineering to accomplish that feat. \n ""What is your name?"" He had a gruff voice, a little harsh, and it still gave her chills. \n ""Faith."" She licked her lips and adjusted a little on the unforgiving hard surface of the table to a more comfortable seated position. Her hands clasped together in her lap since she wasn\'t sure what to do with them. ""I um, just learned of my mother\'s association with the NSO late yesterday evening after her death."" \n ""Association?"" His features hardened and his eyes narrowed. \n ""She created your kind."" The words came out too soft but he heard her. She had no doubt about that when his hands drew her attention as they fisted at his side. It made her aware of just how big he was. She couldn\'t help but notice his massive chest again. He\'d probably gotten that physical trait from what she guessed was a gorilla. His arms were thick too, his waist tapering to slim hips. He was just big. ""You\'re mixed with gorilla DNA? You don\'t exhibit orangutan makers."" \n He growled low and it made her start. Shut up! That order came too late but she was curious. It had been a hellish time since she\'d gotten that call after having lunch with Paul. Her mother\'s death had come as a shock, followed by the late night arrival of her uncle to inform her of his fury at being left out of the will. Uncle Len had painstakingly told her everything she hadn\'t known about her mother and how he\'d see her in hell before he allowed her to inherit a penny. \n ""What makes you say that?"" \n She was terrified to answer but she\'d blurted out that can of worms. ""Um, male orangutans have..."" Her voice gave out and she just raised her hand, using a finger to run along the side of her forehead and eye area. She swallowed. ""Fleshy pads on their faces here. Your coloring is more in line with a gorilla too."" She clasped her hands together again to hide that they trembled. \n ""Why gorilla? Why not chimpanzee?"" He was mad. It still sounded in his tone. \n ""Your size."" \n ""Go on."" He crossed his arms over his chest. ""Explain it to me."" \n ""I didn\'t mean to offend you. I haven\'t slept and I just blurt stuff out. I\'m sorry."" \n ""Explain,"" he snarled. ""Why do you think I\'m a gorilla?"" \n ""I didn\'t say you are one. I think you were engineered with human and gorilla DNA."" \n ""I\'m still waiting."" \n He wasn\'t about to let it go. ""Your black hair. I mean, you could have gotten that from the human side but the shaping of your eyes reminded me of a gorilla and your upper chest and arms are um, really pronounced. The nose threw me but um, yeah. That\'s the first thing that came into my head."" \n ""My nose?"" \n ""Gorillas have larger nostrils but yours aren\'t, um, yeah."" Shut up! She sealed her lips before she learned firsthand if he had a temper and hoped he was more like his gorilla ancestors in that regard. They weren\'t known for being overly aggressive or violent but did put on a scary show if they felt threatened. \n ""Are you a geneticist too?"" \n She shook her head. ""No."" \n ""You seem to know a lot about primates."" \n ""I spent two summers volunteering at a zoo."" She regretted that answer as soon as she realized how bad it sounded. ""I wanted to be a veterinarian,"" she blurted. ""But that didn\'t happen. There was this guy...I\'m going to be quiet now."" \n From what I can tell about Darkness from previous books: \n *He\'s different, but all we know is a very vague comment he makes to Obsidian of ""You were singled out for a mating project while I was assigned to do something else."" \n *He has short dark hair. \n *He\'s mixed with black leopard \n *He ""...isn\'t social but he wouldn\'t terrorize a female"" and tends to avoid females. \n *He leads some sort of security team. \n *He also works as an interrogator for New Species.. \n *He was trained by a mercenary female to seduce females, then killed her when she turned on them. \n So many Species are so nervous around Darkness.

I read Off the Hook, the first book in this series, earlier this year and fell in love with The Buoys, the O'Donnells, and Jessie Todd. Reading Lured In just solidified Drewry's place on my list of favorite authors. I will read anything that she writes, and I can guarantee that I'll love it. \n In Off the Hook, we saw Liam O'Donnell and Kate Hadley revamp The Buoys, Liam's family's old fishing resort, into something more. Now, in Lured In, they've gotten big enough to warrant a visit from a popular fishing tv show. Everybody's thrilled, except for Jessie, who used to date the host and is less than thrilled at the prospect of rekindling that romance. \n Jessie's relationship with Sam ended for a reason. More than one, actually, if she's honest. While Sam might be the cutest and sweetest guy she's ever met, and while Kate and Liam might be all for their reunion (and the publicity it would bring), Jessie was never actually that attracted to Sam. They had next to nothing in common, and the fact that he lives his life touring around on boats didn't quite mesh with her paralyzing fear of water. \n Quite possibly the only good thing about that relationship is that it made Jessie see that she has to get over her fear. So she asks her closest friend and the most patient person she knows, Finn O'Donnell, to help her out. Jessie is so comfortable with Finn that just being near him calms her down, so it's no surprise that, slowly but surely, she's able to dip her toes in the water again. \n While helping Jessie overcome her fear and get past the events that led to it, Finn also gets to talk out some of the traumatic events in his own past. Watching these two finally trust someone enough to open up about their deepest fears made me so happy. They have been carrying around some demons for decades, and I loved that they were able to start moving on. \n This was such a nice friends-to-lovers story. I liked that their relationship progressed naturally. It's not like a lightning bolt strikes Finn and suddenly he realizes that Jessie is gorgeous. No, these two have always felt something for each other, even if they didn't want to admit it. When Finn's father was alive, he would have forbidden any kind of romance between them. Even now that he's gone, Finn's brothers would give him hell for going there. Finn's always been a bit of a player, and his family wouldn't want Jessie to be next in the long line of broken hearts. \n But the great thing is that Jessie doesn't really care. She knows about Finn's history, and she thinks he's worth it. She knows why he acts the way he does, and she understands that commitment might be difficult for him. But she's willing to risk it, because Finn is her best friend, and he's a great person, and their connection is electric. \n Jessie and Finn are some of my favorite characters in recent memory. I always say that Drewry's characters feel like they could be real people, but it's even more true for these two. They're not pawns being moved around for the author's amusement. They act like real people. Their thoughts, actions, and reactions are real. \n I loved these characters, I love this setting, and I love this author. Every book I read from her is better than the last. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.""",4.02,"The O'Donnell brothers continue to cast their lines and find love at the Buoys--their magnificent Pacific Northwest fishing haven--in this alluring romance from the bestselling author of Off the Hook.
Seasick. That's how Jessie Todd feels when her best friend and boss, Finn O'Donnell, tells her that the Buoys will be featured on a popular fishing program--which just so happens to be hosted by a guy she used to date.

His life is out on the sea, and though Jessie works at the resort, her paralyzing phobia of water keeps her on land, where she's safe. To take a shot with Finn, she'll need to face her fears--and her innermost desires--head-on.
Finn has been nursing a crush on Jess for a long time, so when she suddenly asks for swimming lessons, he dives right in. Holding her shaking hand as she steps into the ocean makes his heart swell--despite the sinking feeling that she's just doing it to impress that smarmy TV host.

No it is not a bad story. It is a hard story. It is a challenging story. One that a lot of authors don't tell. Losing It All isn't your typical story of life, love, and hope. Oh no, Marsha Cornelius gives us a story that is so deep in loss and despair that often times you wonder if you are ever going to find that little ray of sunshine. That one tiny glimmer of hope amongst the darkness. \n In Losing It All we follow the paths of two people. Frank, the homeless veteran who is perfectly content with life on the streets. Who battles demons both physical and mental. And Chloe, the mother of two who has everything ripped from her in a single night. Each set of characters starts in a different place. Frank is already in despair, but yet he chooses to be happy with his life. He chooses to make it the best he can. He has friends, he has worth, and he has purpose. \n Chloe starts with hope. With happiness and in one single moment everything is torn apart. She loses everything and is thrown into the world of being a single mom and homeless. She is scared, hopeless, and desperate. But Chloe is a fighter and is determined to get herself out of her bad situation. She chooses to see hope for a brighter future. \n Both characters think that things are as bad as they are going to get. But as Marsha Cornelius shows us, sometimes life deals us a hand full of spades and bleeding hearts. Both Frank and Chloe learn that there is always more to lose. The question is how far down can you go before you break? Before there is no hope of putting you back together. \n Losing It All is that story. It is the story of how bad things can get. Of how far down a person can go before the sun begins to shine again. \n Both of them are dealt crappy hands. Throughout Losing It All there are moments of happiness, hope and love. Of course, Marsha Cornelius is quick to slap that hope off the page. I'm not saying there isn't hope. Because there is. Underneath all the bleak darkness that these two stories lie in there is hope. But they have to fight to get it. They have to battle demons that break most people down to nothing. \n Losing It All is just that. A story about losing it all. That's life. Not everyone is going to get a happy ever after. Not everyone gets roses and sunshine. Some peoples roads are paved with sadness, tears, and bitterness. And Marsha Cornelius does a splendid job of giving us the darker side of life. Losing It All is a beautifully sad story. One that is hard to read because of the truths that lie within its pages. This story is not for that faint at heart, but definitely a story of life and how no matter how bad things get things can get worse and if you let them things can get better. \n *Receive a free copy in exchange for an honest review""",4.27,"Frank Barnes is content living on the streets of Atlanta.

She rekindles his lost sense of self-worth by taking his mind off his own problems. But they will not meet again until Frank is riding high as a working man, and Chloe has hit rock bottom.
By helping Chloe rebuild her broken life, Frank banishes the demons from his own past. Unfortunately, the past comes strolling back into their lives, threatening to destroy the happiness they have finally found.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17619843-losing-it-all,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367963158m/17619843.jpg,24585803,Losing It All,Romance,i am just going to jump into this review losing it all wa a hard story to read and not for the reason you think no it is not a bad story it is a hard story it is a challenging story one that a lot of author don t tell losing it all isn t your typical story of life love and hope oh no marsha cornelius give u a story that is so deep in loss and despair that often time you wonder if you are ever going to find that little ray of sunshine that one tiny glimmer of hope amongst the darkness in losing it all we follow the path of two people frank the homeless veteran who is perfectly content with life on the street who battle demon both physical and mental and chloe the mother of two who ha everything ripped from her in a single night each set of character start in a different place frank is already in despair but yet he chooses to be happy with his life he chooses to make it the best he can he ha friend he ha worth and he ha purpose chloe start with hope with happiness and in one single moment everything is torn apart she loses everything and is thrown into the world of being a single mom and homeless she is scared hopeless and desperate but chloe is a fighter and is determined to get herself out of her bad situation she chooses to see hope for a brighter future both character think that thing are a bad a they are going to get but a marsha cornelius show u sometimes life deal u a hand full of spade and bleeding heart both frank and chloe learn that there is always more to lose the question is how far down can you go before you break before there is no hope of putting you back together losing it all is that story it is the story of how bad thing can get of how far down a person can go before the sun begin to shine again both of them are dealt crappy hand throughout losing it all there are moment of happiness hope and love of course marsha cornelius is quick to slap that hope off the page i m not saying there isn t hope because there is underneath all the bleak darkness that these two story lie in there is hope but they have to fight to get it they have to battle demon that break most people down to nothing losing it all is just that a story about losing it all that s life not everyone is going to get a happy ever after not everyone get rose and sunshine some people road are paved with sadness tear and bitterness and marsha cornelius doe a splendid job of giving u the darker side of life losing it all is a beautifully sad story one that is hard to read because of the truth that lie within it page this story is not for that faint at heart but definitely a story of life and how no matter how bad thing get thing can get worse and if you let them thing can get better receive a free copy in exchange for an honest review,0.9956

I really enjoyed the first book Inn at Sunset Cove and was hoping I would equally enjoy the second. While I did like Mermaid Moon, I didn\'t love it. The story involves Mallory Davis who left her home 15 years before in the wake of a scandal. She returns home when her father dies to try to figure out why he was murdered. She finds herself and her daughter in grave danger as someone seems to want them out of the way. Kevin is her ex-fiance, but being in law enforcement, her agrees to help keep her safe . \n I will say that I did enjoy the mystery in this story. It was really intriguing and had a few twists. There was one big surprise toward the end that I definitely didn\'t see coming. The whole thing kept me guessing and I was eager to get to the end to find out the whole story. What I didn\'t love was romance part of the book. I felt like Mallory and Kevin got back together a bit too quickly for me. I just wasn\'t feeling the bond between them. I also was a bit underwhelmed by the ""scandal"" that sent Mallory fleeing from her home. She kept talking about whispers and looks from the people in the community now that she was back. I was confused because it seemed to me that aside from Kevin\'s parents, everyone she encountered welcomed her with open arms. \n If you are looking for a good clean mystery, there is one in this book. I do recommend checking it out. Characters from the first book play a role in this one, so it was nice to catch up with them.

JUST ONE NIGHT
Jason Hart has just one night to prove to his best friend's older sister that anything is possible . . .
Nicole de Salvo has been in love - and lust - for her little brother's best friend for years. For years she's watched from afar and done nothing about her attraction for Jason Hart only now their time together is almost at an end. On their last night together will she find the courage to do something about her feelings, or will she live with regret for the rest of her life?
ONE SPECIAL NIGHT
It's been nearly six months since Tommy de Salvo's fiancee cheated and left him in the midst of wedding preparations because up-and-coming businessman Tommy was all work and no play. The last thing Tommy wants or needs is to be attracted to another woman who won't be around for too long. A woman just like Navy Corpsman Jasmine Reyes. She's rough, tough, and determined to go it alone, but Tommy knows that if he passes up this opportunity, he may regret it more than the loss of his fiancee ...
Jasmine ""Doc"" Reyes is both emotionally and physically scarred after her tour of duty. Wounded in battle, all she can think about is rebuilding her life and continuing with the career that she's dreamed about since she was a young child. She has no time for rich sexy men who've never had a care in the world and wouldn't understand her determination. But Tommy's charm is seductive and she knows that she has to explore the attraction, even if it's only for this one special night.
ONE LAST NIGHT
It's been over a year since Marine Lieutenant Trevor Mason and his father have spoken. After nearly losing his life during a Taliban attack in Afghanistan, Trevor wants to end the rift between them so he can return to active duty with some peace of mind. But a visit to his father's office only serves to show Trevor that his father isn't as eager to reunite. If not for the intervention of Samuel Mason's spunky and very sexy intern, Trevor would probably be returning to Afghanistan with his one wish unfulfilled.
Trevor Mason had used to do all kinds of things to Maggie Sullivan's insides when she worked at the country club his family used to attend. Five years later, there is little left of the teen she knew in the stoic Marine who only wants some time with his father. When Trevor's father backs out of his son's dinner invitation at the last minute, Maggie does the only thing she can: she goes to Trevor's apartment to deliver the news, but she can't leave him alone on his one last night before returning to duty.
Thrown together, Trevor and Maggie can't ignore the sexual heat between them. As they satisfy one set of needs, another slowly develops as passion breathes life into other emotions. Will Trevor and Maggie's one last night together possibly lead to many other nights in the future?",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444675-take-a-chance,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1414191071m/23444675.jpg,43008071,Take a Chance: Erotic Romance Boxed Set,Romance,great collection of erotic novella i liked that each couple had their own story told but each story wa connected to the others the character are great and you are pulled into each story i wa given this series in exchange for an honest review via netgalley,0.9387

How can this one story consume me? Have me strangely intoxicated? Addicted? It\'s simple. One taste of your raw words was all it took. It didn\'t take much because shot after shot of your literary brilliance, you left me feeling numb, high and sated. I wanted to drown in whiskey. I wanted to feel whiskey. I wanted to be vulnerable to whiskey. I wanted to love whiskey. I wanted to hate whiskey but I couldn\'t because whiskey didn\'t consume me. It was your words Kandi Steiner that I was addicted to. \n ""It turned out a Whiskey stain was just as permanent as ink, and I wondered if I would ever truly wash myself clean. Or if I even wanted to."" \n This story. These characters. These words. These emotions that you had coursing through my veins was the very essence of why I love to read. This was not a story of perfect characters but instead of flawed individuals who continued to make mistakes after mistakes. Individuals who hurt each other emotionally. So how could I be intoxicated on a story where cheating occurred multiple times? The answer to that is simple. Love is complicated. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love is beauty. Love is truth. And the truth of the matter, love can be selfish. Love can be cruel. Love can be an addiction. Good and bad. It can be toxic. But love can make you feel. And the story of Jamie and B was a story that I will happily drown in over and over again. Why would I torture myself in such a complicated love story? Because love is meant to be consuming and a story that makes you feel every fiber of emotions coursing through your veins is a story worth remembering. And this is one love letter to whiskey where I will savor every last drop. \n ""My first taste of Whiskey had been nothing. My first shot? Child\'s play. I\'d been holding back, delicately balancing on the line, afraid of drinking too much --but this was it. I knew it. I felt every inch of the fall from tipsy to drunk. I was completely wasted, and all I wanted was to feel this way forever."" \n Sincerely, \n ~Michelle xo \n Emotionally consuming. Intoxicating. Raw. Flawed. And breathtakingly poignant. These are the words that immediately comes to mind as I sit here in write my review for A Love Letter to Whiskey. Kandi Steiner honestly blew me away with this book. In the three hours that I was held hostage, I felt like I was on an emotional roller-coaster going through the motions and the unexpected twist and turns. In all honesty, I needed a drink after reading this book because my heart and emotions were scattered and beating wildly as I drank in every mistake, love, hurt, and loss the hero and heroine experienced. \n ""Jamie was whiskey, that much I was sure of. I couldn\'t deny the way he burned, the way his taste lingered."" \n That first taste. Once you had your first drop of love, it\'s a high and addiction that you can\'t forget. The buzz that you crave. For Breck, her addiction came in the form of a boy who knocked her world off its axis. The boy she knew who was top shelf material. Yeah he was that drink that was rich, smooth and left a good burn. And that drink was her very own whiskey named Jamie. \n ""I was spinning, tipsy, teetering on the edge of being wasted on Whiskey. I\'d dreamed of kissing Jamie so many times, but nothing could compare to how it really felt --his hands on me, so strong, his mouth skilled and passionate. My legs were weak and he felt it, taking the weight of me in his arms, kissing me like he\'d waited his entire life to have the chance."" \n Jamie and B\'s relationship was built on a friendship that was held by truth, love, and an indescribable connection. To sum it up, it was intense. But like any friendship when feelings are involved, lines would get blurred. And the timing of Jamie and B was never right.When she was single, he was in a relationship. When he was ready for her, she wasn\'t available. But as much as the timing was never right, their feelings were always there but miscommunication and timing was always their downfall. She wasn\'t ready to be fully consumed with whiskey even though she already knew she was drowning in it. \n ""It turned out I was water, he was whiskey, and I couldn\'t dilute him --not now that I knew he loved me enough to let me. I needed to be stronger, to be ice the next time I melted with him."" \n A Love Letter to Whiskey is an utterly raw gripping addictive read. This book was built on a symphony of raw emotions. Emotions that left you frazzled, confused, hurt, angry, sad, and wildly intoxicated. Steiner did not write an ordinary love story but instead a story that left you savoring every drop of her poetic and stunning prose. To the very last drop, you will want a taste of whiskey. You will want to know and experience a selfish kind of love. An addictive kind of love. And most importantly a love that is honest. Real. Raw. A love that leaves you vulnerable and breathless. And so if you are ready to take a sip and get your first taste of a literary masterpiece then I urge you to get drunk on this book. Take a sip, savor the taste, and enjoy the lasting aftertaste of whiskey or in this case Kandi Steiner\'s words. \n ""Even if you must move on, please don\'t ever let us go."" \n Kandi Steiner'",4.32,"It's crazy how fast the buzz comes back after you've been sober for so long.

I liked how the author used the war and violence to showcase what happens to a person's soul afterwards. It gives me even more respect of our nation's servicemen. The plot is full of suspense and mystery and adds an appetizing layer to a delicious romance. An Advanced Reading Copy was received in exchange for an honest review.""",4.19,"August 1815. The war with France is officially over, Napoleon's an exile on St Helena, but Europe is still a very dangerous place to be.
Kidnapped and held for ransom at nineteen, ducal heir William Ravenwood knows the only person he can rely on is himself. Now part of a spy ring that includes his friends Nicolas and Richard Hampden, he's the smuggler known as The Raven, a ruthless agent who specializes in rescuing hostages and prisoners of war from captivity.
Raven longs to discover the fate of his colleague, Christopher 'Kit' Carlisle, who's been missing, presumed dead, for over two years. He's also equally determined to stay away from the one thing he knows is dangerous to his health - the bane of his life, his best friends' infuriating and provocative little sister, Heloise.
Heloise is a brilliant code breaker, one of the English government's most valuable assets. She's also loved Raven for years, but considering that he rejected her at sixteen, before her face was scarred rescuing her brother from an icy river, she's certain he doesn't want her now, despite his outrageous flirting.
But when Heloise decodes a message that proves Kit is alive and a prisoner in Spain, Raven realizes she's in grave danger. With French agents determined to silence her, he'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe - even if that means taking her to Spain with him as an unwilling hostage.
As they face French deserters and Spanish freedom fighters, Raven and Heloise try to ignore the simmering attraction that's been building between them for eight long years. The differences between them are striking but they've always had a strange underlying bond. Heloise might be scarred outwardly, but Raven's wounds are all on the inside. He knows he's not worthy of her love--a shadowed Hades pining for sun-kissed Persephone--but he's not above showing her passion for the short time they're together.
A master at decoding complex messages, Heloise finds Raven frustratingly hard to read, but as their lives hang in the balance she's determined to unravel his secrets and unlock his dark, elusive heart...",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28109659-a-raven-s-heart,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1459133443m/28109659.jpg,48117547,"A Raven's Heart (Secrets & Spies, #2)",Romance,in the war against france heloise hampden is an asset to the crown she s a codebreaker who is being hunted by an assassin however it s the agent assigned to protect heloise who pose the greatest threat to her heart her brother s friend raven aka viscount ravenwood heloise ha known him since childhood yet always maintained a chaste distance she belief nothing will change due to her disfiguring scar so why is she so enchanted by the sight of raven raven belief that he can never love heloise the way she deserves his imprisonment six year ago broke him in a way that make the prospect of love impossible still his heart beat like mad whenever she s around he ll do whatever it take to keep her safe even if that mean taking her to spain a an unwilling hostage can raven keep heloise safe without giving in to the desire of his broken heart this historical romance is beautifully written and everything i love about the genre both main character are strong willed yet have been damaged by different circumstance they have to get through their inner hauntings to see the love in each other s eye i liked how the author used the war and violence to showcase what happens to a person s soul afterwards it give me even more respect of our nation s serviceman the plot is full of suspense and mystery and add an appetizing layer to a delicious romance an advanced reading copy wa received in exchange for an honest review,0.9947

But this was my first foray into a Rachel Van Dyken book. A little ashamed there. Now that's been remedied, and I can say I liked what I read we can move on. \n Fraternize surprised me. Which is a not thing that happens in a straight up romance. I 100% assumed this was going to be a cookie cutter romance. I don't really like to be wrong, but I do like being surprised. So there's that. \n I liked Emerson well enough. She's got a lot going on in her personal life. Add in that her love of cheerleading doesn't look kindly on curvy girls. Emerson has to work twice as hard for her talent to be seen just because of her body. I have no doubt that the girl has a killer, strong body. Of course, she makes the squad and in enters Sanchez; cocky, big talker, determined to make Emerson his best friend/more. Sanchez is so obviously fronting with all his over the top dramatics, that it's really hard to not like the guy. \n Emerson still misses her childhood best friend, Miller. It's a thing she constantly thinks about even though he hurt her. Well, hey, guess what? Miller just happens to be traded and apparently, he hate misses Emerson too. Fraternize also gives us alternating chapters from Miller's POV. It was a most excellent way to see Miller and their shared pass in two different lights. Because clearly, Emerson doesn't know the whole story. And vice versa. \n I want to say that yea, Fraternize has that love triangle thing going on. But at the end of the day, all there are in their early twenties. Emerson is leading neither of them on. And things might just surprise you. Feelings and emotions get confused and messy. Just maybe the past should stay in the past. Who knows what the future really holds. \n Fraternize is a super light and fun sports-centered romance. It gets silly and cheesy at many a times. But that's what I was expecting. I wanted a good time. Emerson has to put up with caddy cheerleaders who hide their jealousy through mean comments. Sanchez offers her an escape. Well, Miller offers her the truth. It's not all about boys and love. Emerson makes a few strong friendships along the way. Body image is a talking point. But these boys are great about hyping her up. \n I thoroughly enjoyed Fraternize; my first Rachel Van Dyken read. I am so looking forward to the next book in this companion series.""",4.26,"New York Timesbestselling author Rachel Van Dyken kicks off a brand-new series in which romance is a game and love is a touchdown.
Emerson just made her dream come true as a professional cheerleader for her favorite pro football team. But even though the plus-size athlete is breaking down boundaries, she still has to contend with the massive rulebook. Carbs? Nope. Chocolate? Definitely not. Still, Emerson loves her curves, and she'll rock the hell out of this job even if it kills her. Except for one mandate that is easier read than done...
No fraternizing with the players.
Problem one is Miller Quinton: Emerson's first love, first sex, and the guy who still ignites her daydreams andR-rated fantasies. Thrown back together, Miller and Emerson feel the undeniable pull of passion again, even if the conflict that tore them apart seems insurmountable. Then there's way-too-sexy Grant Sanchez. He has a serious reputation with the ladies, and when it comes to winning someone he wants, he doesn't let anyone stand in his way.
Now Emerson is breaking every rule in the manual.

It makes me a very happy reader. NA is a hard genre. With it being a somewhat new genre and one that is very popular, it is of course being flooded with books. Which makes me a little weary when I pick a new title and/or a new author. There is a lot of crap out there. But thankfully there's books like Luck on the Line in there that keeps me coming back again and again. NA is really starting to become my comfort genre. There's such a wide range from fluff to the darker stuff. It's good for any mood. Luck on the Line falls more towards the lighter side. It's not fluff. It's just a fun and heart warming read. But be warned, do not read this book on an empty stomach. It's going to make you hungry either way, just maybe have some snacks ready. \n Lucky is making her yearly trip home to Boston and her mom. She's kind of a wanderer and has been away from home since she left high school. She changes colleges and jobs as fast as you can blink. But the one things she's sure of is that she doesn't belong in Boston where her mom is. Her mom, a food network star. Her mom, who's on the verge of opening a new restaurant, The Star. Her mom who is probably searching for husband #5. It's clear that Lucky and her mom don't really see eye to eye. \n Anyhow, upon Lucky's stop in a coffee shop on the way to her mom's, she's witness to a guy chatting up the barista. It's such a major eye-roll moment, but he's holding up the line so she not so kindly points that out. There's a little bit of a confrontation and she runs off with his coffee. Lucky meets her mom who than shoves her into the restaurant and tells her she needs to help out. Lucky takes over manager duties, well her mom buggers off. Lucky just keeps reminding herself that she's only here for a few weeks. She can handle it. That is until she runs into coffee shop player guy(James). In The Star's kitchen. Turns out he's The Star's executive chef. This is his kitchen. Lucky can't believe her luck. Not only is this guy hot but he's a total ass. Well at least she thought he was an ass. \n Like I mentioned above, this is a fun book. Lucky is a great character. She's easy to connect with. Her sassy take charge attitude can get her into hot water. But it also gets her through the opening of the restaurant where the workers actually listen to her. Lucky comes from a more privileged upbringing and that has kind of allowed her to change her area of study so frequently. But she's also really hard working. Lucky has tried to break out of that life. She works at bars and restaurants to prove to herself that she can make her own way. It's also clear that she's a bit of a runner. I think she's kind of scared to just stay in one place. I think she's scared of the stability that would bring. Coming home this time around was different. Lucky has always blamed herself for her father's death. And because of that she feels she also lost her mom. She doesn't get why her mom took such a turn in her lifestyle. It's another one of those times where talking helps. The lack of communication and pretty much non-existent relationship between the two of them is not just Lucky's fault. Lucky can see her mom going down hill and it's finally the kick in the ass for her to finally have a discussion with her mom. Yes, they talk, but I liked how everything wasn't okay right away. Because(like in real life) it takes time. But progress was made. And Lucky showed some real growth and understanding towards her mom. Lucky was just a fun and smart girl. Sometimes she didn't know when to keep her mouth shut but she didn't shy away from anything that was thrown her way. \n Oh man, I never knew chefs could be so hot. Seriously this year I've been all over the guys that work at tattoo parlors. But now I think I'm going to be searching for some NA books that take place in restaurants and such. There needs to be more hot chefs in NA. Authors take note. James is a true Bostonian. Irish background and rough past. He comes off as a bit of a douchebag. But he's really just scared of his past catching up to him. James is kind of a local celebrity having one a cooking show. But he's not really into the spotlight. He just wants to make a name for himself and show everyone how brilliant of a chef he is. Like he said, food saved him. And it's clear he's good at what he does. Lucky throws a bit of a wrench into his plans. Stella's(Lucky's mom) bratty daughter shows up and is all of the sudden calling the shots. He's supposed to work with her. Nicely. James is obviously a little frustrated. But after a truce is called and they spend some more time together they really can't hide their attraction for each other. It's swoon worthy. It's easy for them to butt heads but as they both aren't ones to really put up with shit they will eventually call each other out. Lucky finds it easy to just spill her secrets to James and well James might be more hesitant he eventually realizes she's the only one he actually wants to air his rough past to. Put once everything came to light it was another reason why they connected so easily; their pasts was something they could understand about each other. I just really enjoyed their relationship. It was hot when it needed to be, but there was no insta-love. No once was the word uttered. They just both realized the other offered them a safe place and they wanted to stay around and figure out why. It helped that they were a good team and would back each other up. Which is what is needed in a running a restaurant. \n There was a really easy flow to the story and dialogue. Nothing was fake. The characters felt like actual people not characters. And the side characters weren't just there because. They added to the story. Lucky needed close friends and she made those. Felicity, Bradley, Bella, and the rest just added a great dimension to Lucky's story. It wasn't completely all about her and James. She was learning that not all old friendships are healthy, people grow apart. And she was learning she needed to make new friends. Which is one of the reasons why I seem to love these companion NA series. Because the characters will be around for more than one book they all get a part. I'm now guessing(and hoping) who the next book is focused on. \n I think Luck on the Line is a good place for new readers of NA to start or readers that aren't into a lot of sex. There is sex but it doesn't take over the story. There's just enough. As well as the story and characters being fun and easy to connect to. I LOL'd quite a bit. I swooned in there too. Plus there's growth and heart warming moments. As well as a lot of yummy food described in detail. Hell, I think Luck on the Line will just appeal to romance readers as a whole. It's a great book. I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series. I can't wait to find out who it'll be about.""",3.66,"To turn her life around, she'll have to stand the heat. To fulfill his dreams, he'll have to get Lucky.
Despite her name, Lucky Pierce has always felt a little cursed. Refusing to settle for less or settle down, she changes jobs as often as she changes boyfriends. When her celebrity chef mother challenges her to finish something, Lucky agrees to help her launch Boston's next hot restaurant, The Star. Even if it means working with the infuriating, egotistical, and undeniably sexy head chef.
James loves being known as Boston's hottest bad boy in the kitchen, but if he wants to build a reputation as a serious chef, he has to make this restaurant work and keep his scandalous past out of the headlines. Getting involved with his boss's spoiled, sharp-tongued daughter is definitely not on the menu.
As the launch of The Star looms and the tension and chemistry heat up in the kitchen, they're going to need more than a little luck to keep everything from boiling

So in this day in age, is there such a thing as Prince Charming? Or are we all victims to the idea of the happily ever afters. Well, I'm here to tell you Lauren Smith has only one answer. Yes, they do exist. Although this Prince Charming may not be knocking on your door on a white horse or a glass slipper in hand but this real life hero who will sweep you off your feet might be the sweet and protective man that you will least expect. So are you ready to discover and read a modern day romance that will have hearts exploding with so much love with that fairy tale happily ever after ending? \n Jared Redmond literally fell in love at first sight when he saw Felicity Hart sleeping in his bed. Who would have thought a woman dressed in Princess gown will be the one to turn his world on it's axis? You see Felicity attended a Halloween party and fell asleep on her friend's brother's bed thinking Jared won't be coming home. So when Jared sees his own version of Sleeping Beauty, he couldn't help but be drawn to her beauty and innocence. From that moment on, he wanted to know Felicity. \n As Jared pursues Felicity, he begins to get to know her. The real her. Her dreams, passion and goals. Soon Jared makes it known to Felicity that friendship is off the table because he wants her. He wants to make her his. When Felicity finally admits her attraction and feelings for Jared, sparks are flying. Love is in the air. But what happens when Felicity plans to move to California? Will Jared be able to walk away from making partner in a law firm just to be with Felicity? And will Felicity be able to walk away from Jared? \n In this over-saturated genre of romance where alpha males are the in new trend, I applaud Lauren Smith for making a story where the sweet guy wins the girl. As much as I love an alpha male, it is refreshing to read a story where the characters just feel real. They face normal everyday problems and misunderstandings.

This was a man she wanted. Rather desperately."" \n The pressure is on Heather to knock out a wedding in less than three months and of course the bride is giving Heather full reigns. The bride unwillingly to help Heather is causing her added stress since the bride won\'t budge on the location of the ceremony and reception. And on top of that, Heather\'s next door neighbor is constantly blasting music in the early mornings. \n When Heather goes to confront the unruly next door neighbor, Heather is in for a surprise when she is greeted by sexy abs. Well Mr. Sexy Abs was more than happy to flirt and tease Heather. And soon Heather and Josh began to form somewhat a friendship. As much as they annoy each other, they soon found themselves crossing that imaginary line from friends to sex buddies. But what happens when Heather wants more than just casual but a real relationship? Will Josh be able to give Heather a commitment or will he push her away? Also, will Heather be able to pull off the wedding of Danica Robinson or will she find herself failing? \n For Better or For Worse was a sweet, charming sexy romance that perfectly weaved passion, friendship, family, second chances, banter and love into one intoxicating and entertaining read. Lauren Layne had her readers walking down the aisle with a big fat smile on their faces as she treated her readers to a romance that had heart, steam and the infamous banana bread. This book was aptly titled since Josh Tanner is afraid of falling in love and committing since he was a cancer survivor and is afraid that his illness will come back and so he doesn\'t do relationships that is until Heather aka 4C comes banging into his life. And this book is a perfect reminder when love knocks, you must be willing to open it all the way and for Josh Tanner, love came knocking and bearing banana bread and a feisty blonde who stole his heart. This story may have been a modern version of The Wedding Planner but Lauren Layne has made this book stand out on its own with her gorgeous and heartfelt prose. She has layered this story with every facets of love, vulnerability, second chances, and of course steam. So if you are looking for a story where a man who didn\'t believe in the future falls madly in love with a woman, who believes in the magic of forever then I highly recommend you to read For Better or For Worse. \n Lauren Layne'",4.15,"Will a budding wedding planner and her bad boy neighbor stop banging heads and start hearing wedding bells in the sexy second novel in USA TODAY bestselling author Lauren Layne's irresistible new series that marries Sex and the City with The Wedding Planner?

He could be glacial. Impenetrable. Then she\'d catch a glimpse of his warmth. His humanity . Raw sexuality twined with something she could only call a sweetness, impossible as that descriptor seemed given the rest of the package . It was the mystery of that paradox that had her tantalized. But she\'d have to be careful."" \n Intriguing!!!! This is the first word that comes to mind when describing Make Me Forget, the first serial installment by Beth Kery. Ms. Kery has perfectly and intricately laid out a story that piqued my interest as she introduces Harper McFadden, a young investigative journalist, who recently left her job in San Francisco to take up residence in Lake Tahoe as an editor for a local newspaper. Harper wants to forget her past, her pain, and the loss of her parents and hopes her time in Lake Tahoe will help clear her mind. \n As Harper was taking in her new residence, she never expected to run into a young mysterious man and his lovable big pup. They exchanged a few pleasantries with each other but nothing serious. On her first day, Harper gets an exclusive personal invitation to a cocktail party hosted by Jacob Latimer. Harper knows very little of Jacob and is shocked as to why she was invited. At the party, she soon discovers that the man she met at the lake is Jacob Latimer. \n Jacob Latimer is a self made man. He leads a secretive life and wants to forget things of his past. And with Harper, she became the distraction that he needs. Together Harper and Jacob can forget things of the past. But what does Harper and Jacob really want to forget? \n ""I mean that you want to forget so many things. I can help you forget , Harper. You can help me forget some things, too. Maybe that\'s why you came back."" \n I love the premise of this serial and can\'t wait to discover what secrets will be unraveled in the next installment. Make Me Forget was sexy, mysterious, and had that Beth Kery signature of intrigue.

The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive. In Grace For Drowning by Maya Cross, be prepared to be consumed in this emotionally gripping tale of two broken people trying to escape the darkness. Can two broken individuals find love and comfort a second time around? Or is the pain and hurt too much to bear? Nothing is black and white. Love is not perfect. The truth hurts. And behind their eyes is a story to be told. \n Staring at the bottom of the bottle, Grace is drowning in sadness and loss. Spiraling down, she is stuck in the shadows of depression where she is gripping with the loss of her fiance's suicide. Memories of her fiance haunts Grace and the only thing she can numb her broken heart is alcohol. Emotionally vacant and sadness consuming her, Grace's only salvation comes in the form of a stranger, who understood the emptiness behind her eyes. \n When Logan first spotted Grace at the bar, he knew behind her tough exterior lies also a broken individual who is drowning in sorrow, guilt, and loss. There was some magnetic pull that drew Logan to Grace. He wanted to help her since he knew what it was like having alcohol as crutch. As much as Grace tries to push Logan away, she was immediately drawn to him. \n The connection between Logan and Grace was absolutely moving and touching. Ms. Cross did an amazing job showcasing two people who were broken and found salvation in each other. Though, what started as an unconventional romantic tale, the battles and obstacles they endured was a testament that love conquers all. Logan and Grace are not perfect but the imperfections of their love makes it perfect for them. For years, Logan was living in the shadows of the dark and Grace brought light back into his eyes and heart. Not only did Logan save Grace from drowning but Grace healed Logan in more ways she could have imagined. Behind their eyes, lies a couple who found light, hope, love and the meaning to live. \n One word to describe Grace For Drowning: Beautiful!!! This book was so well written that I found myself devouring this book in one sitting. Ms. Cross literally took her readers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. Grace and Logan's emotional journey as couple gutted my heart and played with my emotions. I felt every ounce of their pain, loss, heartbreak, love, sadness, and happiness. The emotional and physical connection between these two were so strong that you could feel their love being evoked in each page. The beauty in this book is the message that love heals and hope never fails. Grace and Logan's story truly made you believe in the power love and second chances. If you are looking for a story that will grip you then I highly recommend Grace for Drowning. It took my heart, twisted it around, tore it to pieces, and slowly taped it back together. \n More reviews found at: http://fourchicksflippingpages.weebly... \n Maya Cross""",3.84,"From the New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal best-selling author of The Alpha Group comes a new romance about the devastating power of guilt and two people's struggle to overcome their pasts. 
Hope is a dangerous thing. I know that more than most. Everything good I've ever had has been stolen from me -- my friends, my fiance, my innocence, some would say even my sanity. All I have left is the cage. Fighting is the only thing that eases the ache inside me even a little. It's the only thing that keeps the bottle at bay.
I was content to ride out my life alone. I was done dreaming that things could be better. But then I met Grace, and from that moment, all I could do was dream.
She's battling those same demons, only she's losing. I don't want to care, but something about her calls to me. That pain in her eyes is so sharp, so familiar. I know it's only a matter of time before it pulls her below the surface.
I can help her, and maybe, just maybe, she can help me too. For the first time in what feels like forever, I've got hope, and that scares the hell out of me.
This book is told from dual perspectives, so both Grace and Logan get their say. It is a full length (300 page) novel with no cliffhanger. There is likely to be a sequel, but the story can be enjoyed alone.

She lives in a time when the children of the United States contract a horrible disease that most likely kills them. Most of her class died because of this disease, but she's been lucky and hasn't caught it. Or at least that's what she thinks. On the day of her tenth birthday, she goes into the kitchen for her family's famous chocolate birthday pancakes, only her mother hasn't cooked them and doesn't even know who Ruby is. She takes her into the garage and sends in Ruby's father to get to the bottom of this, but he doesn't know who she is either and calls the police. The police don't come. Instead Psi agents do and take her away to a camp. \n As it turns out, if the children don't get IANN, or they survive it, it means that they are 'special.' Ruby has a special ability to make people forget things and when she is sent for classification she makes her tester forget what type she has and is labeled a Green - they use a rainbow scale to determine how dangerous a kid's ability is Red being the most dangerous, Blue being the least. Six years later, thanks to a White Noise test - a high pitched frequency that only the psi kids can hear and causes them to go immobile - Ruby is sent to the medical wing where she learns the shocking truth. The Psi guards have been testing out a new frequency to pick up any Red, Orange or Yellows that they might have missed. But lucky for Ruby, her nurse doesn't work for the Psi Guard she works for the Children's League and has every intention of getting her out before the guard kills her. But Rub knows that help always comes with a price. \n I came across the book multiple times whenever I went into the book tag on Pinterest. I read the summary once and wasn't sure this would be my kind of book, but a lot of my bookish friends told me that I should give it a go. I'm glad I took them up on their advice. The Darkest Minds is a really good dysotopian tale.""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

But the ones that survive, mutate in a way that they gain some sort of powers. The government took the kids that survived (with the permission of his parents or not) into camps that supposedly can rehabilitate the kids, but in reality they just lived oppressed. The kids are divided in color: green are the super smart ones, blue the ones with telekinesis, yellow the ones that can control electricity, red the ones that control fire, and orange the ones that can use mind powers. Ruby is an orange, but is living in a camp as a green. She is scared of her powers, of the monster that she believes she is and what her powers accidentally did to her loved ones. \n I LOVED this book. A dystopian book about super powers? Count me in! \n What I liked about this book: the world, the setting, the characters, the powers. I loved Ruby; she was strong, smart, but flawed. She exasperated me at times but not to the point of disliking her. I also loved Liam, Chubs and Zu. Liam was perfect, sweet and strong but also reckless and sincere. He was a lovable flawed love interest. I hope we see every character develop even more in the next books. \n And then there is Clancy. What a fascinating character.

I\'m not sure what exactly I was looking for, but I just wanted more. \n There were so many aspects I feel very neutral about. The concept and back story were interesting, but it\'s something we have all seen before. The plot was extremely slow paced. I found the ending to be very fast, but overall pretty predictable. The characters were believable, but I didn\'t find myself getting attached to them until the very end. The romance elements felt a little off. Overall, this book just left me feeling ""meh."" I have no strong feelings either way about it. \n I would categorize this book as more of a ""survivalist"" story than a dystopian. The world feels more post-apocalyptic than anything else, so fans of that kind of storyline will probably enjoy this. The characters felt very realistic as well, so if you prefer character driven stories, I would recommend this. \n I do plan on continuing with the series, but as of right now, I am in no rush to do so. I hope the next book picks up the pace a little more and is less predictable.

I'd been seeing this book get nothing but glowing reviews from people on Goodreads, so my expectations were pretty high and I had been looking forward to it for a while. Unfortunately though, my wait just seemed to end with nothing but disappointment. \n I'll start with the positives, since this book really isn't completely terrible. I really enjoyed the overall concept, kids with powers, hitler style concentration camps, camp breakouts, different classes of powers. The whole thing felt very dystopian meets X-Men, and in the beginning I was kind of enjoying it...but then the middle came. \n Now the middle of this book is basically our cast of characters searching for somewhere, which leads to lots of meandering exposition. I stuck with it because reviews had mentioned that the last 100 pages were brilliant, but while I thought they were better than what came before, they weren't good or interesting enough (for me) to save the book from a two 'it was okay' star rating. I was torn enough to ALMOST give it a three, but then I realised I have very little intention of picking up the sequel, so I can't really say I liked it. \n It was the characters that were the biggest letdown here. I've read enough YA now that a book really can just die without an interesting main or side character to draw me in, and this book just didn't deliver on that. I'd even go as far as to say that I found the main character, Ruby, kind of annoying. I found her to be weak, and without a backbone, always doubting herself when she was one of the more powerful (let's call them) mutants about. The side characters then, while less annoying, were just a little bland, and I didn't get attached to them. It also took me about two weeks to finish this book, which is unusual for me as I tend to fly through things pretty fast, but this just proves that it was lacking that 'hook'. \n Now it's easy to focus on the bad points when writing a review, so I'd like to point out that this book really isn't that terrible. The writing is generally really good, and I can even see why people enjoy it. I also seem to be one of the few people who didn't love this, so I'm just going to go ahead and call this a 'it's me, not you' book. I was disappointed, but you might not be, we will just leave it at that.""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

I really like that trilogy (well, books 1 & 2 so far). So many parts of it, even in the last few pages when Ruby talks about feeling like she\'s unwinding (she means it in a different, but still similar way). If you like those books, you will like this book. My main complaint with the Unwind series was that there wasn\'t much movement. The Darkest Minds doesn\'t have that problem. There was movement, it wasn\'t a bunch of the same thing, waiting for the story to start, getting to the end and realizing that was the story. However..... the ending. I don\'t know if the ending makes me want to bump this book up to 5 stars or drop it down to 1. Because HOW COULD THE AUTHOR DO THAT TO ME?! I\'m pretty oblivious, never see twists coming, etc. so maybe I should\'ve seen how Ruby would fix this. In hindsight, it is the most obvious solution. It reminds me of One Flew Over The Cuckoo\'s Nest (which also, has lines talking about rabbits accepting their fate, at least in the play - I\'m pretty sure they reference Watership Down). It crushed me. CRUSHED ME. Nearly had my 4 y.o. in tears because I was sobbing, sitting next to him, barely able to choke out, while pointing at the book, ""It\'s okay. It\'s just a sad, sad story."" I mean, it snuck up on me. I thought things were somehow going to be okay. Then they weren\'t. I haven\'t read the blurb for book 2 yet, but I can\'t understand how there can possibly be a sequel without Liam. My husband, not knowing anything about the book, but being very intuitive and hard to pull a twist past, said, ""It was all a dream!"" That made me think, ""She didn\'t erase herself from his memories. She just adjusted them so they could get through this tight spot & they\'ll meet on the flip side. OR she didn\'t erase herself. She coached him so that he\'d look like it, somehow, and he was essentially faking the memory loss."" That\'s what I\'m going to go with this ending which I hate. \n ETA: I read the blurb for book 2 (Never Fade). I figured out that I don\'t really think this book was about Ruby, it was about Ruby AND Liam AND Chubs and the relationships between them all. Without Liam, Ruby isn\'t much of a character! How can this 2nd book work without Liam, specifically without a Liam/Ruby relationship, preferably with Chubs there, too?! \n It\'s been a few hours and I\'m still in a daze, in denial. This is tearing my heart out. :-( . \n I recommend that if you are this kind of person: \n you wait until October 2013 to read this so that Never Fade will be out when you finish. Just a bit of advice. \n ETA: I\'m bumping this up to 5 stars. Anything that was on the brink of 5 stars that has me obsessing about it this long after finishing it \n deserves a bump up.'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

Ruby Daly is the heroic protagonist, that\'s lived in fear her whole life of ""being a monster"" escapes Thurmond, runs in hiding with people that promised her safety and help. Which turns out to be total false. Escapes again and falls into the arms of three strangers who are like her and escape for...I would say the very same thing she\'s trying to run from minus all the other reasons why they are running from too... \n Okay, now that\'s maybe the first few chapters, then in a way my suspense went down hill. Don\'t get me wrong this book overall was very intriguing in ways I\'d admire.There were a couple of chapters...let me just say were long, and some chapters kept going on and on about things I felt were to shallow.At this point I was already drawn to Liam & Ruby; a love triangle that ,didn\'t really get nowhere...then went somewhere...but not exactly where I wanted them to go.But I continued their adventure, and fallowed through with disappointing things that made me hate some characters, and then some. I didn\'t know who to hate at this point: The Children\'s League or the PSF\'s...then it really makes you question who\'s really the good heros PSF\'S or the Childrens League. Hopefully I will come to surfaces with that in the next book, strangely at this point after reading halfway down the middle of this book each one thought that finding the Slip Kid would be their safety net and not only that but their savior. Turns out all the ""Slip Kid"" was, wsd a silly douche of an offspring to the president that\'s help orchestrated this whole fiasco with kids who are deadly. Then after reading nearly towards the end, it became once again interesting. But...but...NO!!! Zu,who was strange but I\'ve learned to adore, departures strangely in one chapter, and was never herd from again. I get it she left with her cousin to go to California with yellows , but I just thought it was bad timing for her to leave; they all needed to be together. After, Ruby reunited with Liam after his brutal attack that Clancy aka the Slip Kid had done...it couldn\'t have gotten worse. After so much turmoil these kids suffer enough. Enough was never Enough!!! The task that finally would relieve so closure for Chubs was cut short by a bullet...at this point I\'m already beyond frustrated. Just when I thought the worse was yet to come...it kept going. No running away laying on the beach for Liam & Ruby; instead that\'s to be concluded into the next book. ARGH!!!! \n Overall, I give it four in a half, because it was good, usually with these types of story it\'s about a three. I mean it could have gone there with the way it was taking me to finish this book. But in the end, it did satisfy me on some levels; were I will meet with the other conclusion in yhe next chapter.'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

I didn\'t mark it as DNF b/c I wasn\'t totally writing it off. I was just putting it aside for later. WAY later. So when people started talking about The Darkest Minds last year, I didn\'t pay much attention. \n Then one of my favorite writers reviewed it as THEBESTBOOKEVEROMG!! So I bought it when it came out. And it sat on a shelf for a year. \n Then a bunch of bloggers started reviewing it. A year later. And they\'re all THEBESTBOOKEVEROMG!! So I just had to jump on that bandwagon to see what I\'d been missing. \n *throws book at wall* \n The Darkest Minds is about a generation of youth who are born with superhero-like abilities. The additional abilities are jump-started at the onset of puberty. The kids who don\'t die when their brains basically EXPLODE, are bused to government camps where they are ""rehabilitated."" There are five divisions of abilities: \n Green: super smarts \n Blue: telekinesis \n Yellow: manipulation of electricity \n Orange: mind control \n Red: fire starters \n Greens and Blues are safe, Yellows are in the middle, and Oranges and Reds are frickin\' dangerous. Ruby (our MC) is an Orange, but she gets placed with the Greens (which is good b/c Big Brother starts killing off Oranges when they can\'t be ""rehabilitated""). If you\'re wondering why I keep putting ""rehabilitated"" in quotations, it\'s b/c I still don\'t know what it\'s supposed to mean. Lots of things are alluded to in reference to the camps and what happens there: scientific experiments (electro-shock therapy style), isolation, sensory deprivation, rape-as-punishment by the a**hole guards, but all of those things are in reference to studying/exploitation, not ""curing"" an ""illness."" \n And I don\'t know about you guys, but sometimes when I start reading a book, I immediately have issues with it. In The Darkest Minds, my first issue was that there is a line that you can point to (like B.C. and B.C.E.) and on one side you have normal kids, and on the other side you have mutant freaks. Every single kid. BUT . . . wait for it . . . only AMERICAN kids. \n Eh?? \n Because last time I checked, Americans (myself included) were a bunch of mutts. The fact that I know I\'m 25% Lithuanian is HUGE. Hardly anyone is a full quarter of anything in America. My other 75% is half a dozen different nationalities THAT I KNOW OF. If it were kids of Western European descent or Eastern European or Asian, etc. I could maybe buy into the whole idea (but it would still be hard b/c these things happen over time, NOT immediately), but it\'s not. It\'s just Americans. \n Willful Suspension of Disbelief only works if the subject is remotely believable. \n So that was a huge problem for me. Almost as big as the previously mentioned rape-as-punishment allusion. Not cool ever. REALLY not cool in a YA book. A girl covers for her friend and mouths off to the guards which results in the girl getting gang-raped for two days. \n *retrieves book to throw it at wall again* \n And then there\'s the triangle. The only reason I picked up on the ""interest"" between Ruby and Boy1 was b/c all of a sudden someone\'s staring at someone else\'s lips. But that wasn\'t terrible. I liked Boy1 and once I knew what was going on, I was cool with it.

My biggest objection was only alluded to, and very briefly at that. And maybe there\'s a perfectly rational explanation for why only American kids mutate and I\'m to obtuse to see it.

Depending on you power you where put into groups of color: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red being the most dangerous of them all. Ruby is an Orange hidden away as green. She uses her power to trick them. The thing about Ruby is she could never control her power ..well more like never tried. She was more scared of her self then anything else. She can read peoples minds and even take away their memory's. She tries her best to never touch people. To her if she just listens to the rules and does what she is told she will be fine. \n six years later. these people break her out with warning that she was caught and they will kill her. Not having any choice, she escapes out of the camp. Ruby soon after realizes that they are lying to her and keeping something from her. so she runs from them. \n Ruby comes across a little girl name Zue and two boys named Liam and Chubs. They set off to East River to find the Slip Kid, a place rumored to be a save zone for kids like them. On there adventure she tries to keep her power a secret and lies to them even tho she is slowly falling in love with Liam. The book tricks you into thinking there is a love triangle but no..oh no far from a love triangle. Ruby learns she can't trust the people in East Rivers and lets just say the other guys is a huge A-Hole. \n The ending of the book was really sad. You watch Ruby grow more towards the end. In the beginning she was more stand off-ish but when you get towards the end you see that she becomes more brave and strong. She does what ever she can to keep the people she cares for save even it meant to make them forget. \n I really enjoyed the book a lot. Another book this week that i couldn't find much flaws. The writing was really good and so is the characters. I highly recommend this book. I don't know if its cause i just really like dystopian's or what but this week has been a good week of reading.

I don't know if my mind can ever fully process this book and it's complexity and beauty. \n Alexandra Bracken has really gone above and beyond with this book. I can see why the internet and bookshops exploded with the release of this novel. \n In this world, children are affected by a disease specifically targeting them before puberty. Many children develop talents, powers, and aren't even aware of what they're doing till later on. Blamed by adults and government officials, they are corralled and taken away to the equivalent of concentration camps, where they are classified into levels by color--red, orange, yellow, blue. Many are killed, but some live and are studied in these camps, suppressed and kept from their families. It isn't until a rebel cause helps Ruby escape that the action begins, but the outside world with all her freedom is just as suffocating and gilded as those camps were and everywhere she turns someone wants to use Ruby for her powers or kill her because of them. \n As one of the last surviving orange-level minds out there, Ruby is dangerous because of what she knows and what she can do. Reaching into others' minds, she not only sees their memories but knows their darkest secrets, the blackness of their hatred, and evil can come in ordinary and extraordinary. But being told you're evil for most of your life and refusing yourself human touch can leave its mark. In her quest to save the world, including her love, Ruby gives him and her freedom up. \n My emotions were all over the place. This story is one of those that can be for young adults or full grown men. Yes, there is a love-factor as almost all stories nowadays do, but the overall storyline and takeaway message is so much bigger than a teenager romance or heartbreak, and I think everyone could benefit from reading this at some point in their lives. \n This book touches on human ignorance, fear, power, how we treat one another, and of course is on-par with the dystopian societies. As I write this review I can think back on parts of the story that touched me, areas where I had to actually stop reading to take some time to think about what was being said or to pull myself together and others where I was so engrossed that the world fell away.""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

Almost every time I opened Tumblr, there was some sort of edit for the series on my dash. Goodreads continued recommending it to me. Libraries had absurd numbers of holds for it. \n I've never been a huge fan of dystopias in general, which is probably why I waited so long to pick up The Darkest Minds. True, it came with glowing reviews and a unique premise - children all over the country are dying, and the ones who aren't are sent to horrible government camps where they're sorted according to special abilities and distinguished by color - but even though I love special powers in books, I couldn't pull myself past the whole dystopia thing. \n Until this book. I never should have waited so long. \n The Darkest Minds may start off with the heroine, Ruby, in a brutal camp, as bleak and brutal as promised, but as we learn that she is an Orange, someone who can mess with other people's minds, we also learn how dangerous and useful someone like her can be. Having lied about her color classification, Ruby and another orange are smuggled out of her camp by a mysterious woman before anyone can realize what they can do, but the twists start up again when Ruby escapes from her rescuers. At this point in the book, she joins up with a small group of other escapees from another camp to travel all over Virginia in search of East River, both a place where escaped kids can be safe and where they can find the elusive Slip Kid, rumored to be able to get kids in touch with families. \n Ruby is the sort of heroine who both empathizes with others but also can distance herself from them. True, she makes some questionable decisions - sometimes on a whim - but she isn't the type to be blinded by love and be so consumed that she can't think straight. (Once you've read the book, particularly the ending, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.) The main love interest, Liam, is also empathetic, and his open heart and confidence in helping out all the other kids is such a nice change from the bad boys of literature. He's an absolute sweetie. His friend Chubs starts off on a bit of a sour note, but he eventually develops a solid friendship with Ruby. And of course, Zu, who may be emotionally scarred but is adorable and loyal and loves everything pink. \n Throughout the course of the novel, the reader glimpses small bits of Ruby's memories from her past, and immediately we are given the sense that something went wrong before she was sent to her camp. These details come in pieces, as do many other details, something that works so well. No information is simply dumped on the reader; instead, we're left to figure things out for ourselves and/or wait for the clues to all come together. This might make it sound like there is a lot of assumption involved, but Bracken does such a good job of weaving in clues that we never feel like we're completely in the dark. It's refreshing to have a lack of details that are just given. The voice is much more authentic. \n I thought the end of The Darkest Minds was going in such a different direction (just as it started looking a little less bleak, BAM)...(I hope that wasn't a spoiler)...but then there are several twists, one right after another. I'm still a little bit in a state of shock from the end, and I'm absolutely going to have to start reading the sequel immediately to know what comes of that final twist! \n Even if you aren't typically into dystopian novels, pick up The Darkest Minds. It's refreshing, original, and witty - definitely worth all the hype!""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

Flip a coin to decide with feeling is overwhelmingly more than the other. I guess I can do that, or I can simply just speak my mind... (Insert Mulan gif here). \n Anyway, I find The Darkest Mind slightly confusing. Okay, more than that. It totally befuddled me from the very beginning, and I pretty much want to slam Ruby\'s head (along with Liam\'s head, and Clancy\'s head, and pretty much every freakin\' character\'s head) in a wall, because I just don\'t like this book. Every word of it is like that White Noise Ruby speaks of. So annoying, ear piercing. (And I\'m probably a Green, because it doesn\'t affect me so much). \n And I really don\'t like how the author holds back information about the Green, Blue, Orange, and Red system. It is so annoyingly annoying, and I really hate it. Really, really, really. It is as annoying as all of these ""annoying""s and ""really""s I put in this review. (Please notice that they do have a point in this review). \n But let\'s get into the color system. Green and Blue aren\'t very dangerous. Green is highly intelligent and probably has photographic memory. Blue is super strong and has telekinesis and some other powers, I assume. Orange can manipulate minds. And there is that other color, which I presume is the deadliest of them all. Red. What does Red do? I have no idea, but I find it interesting that Ruby\'s name is Ruby (isn\'t that redundant?). Ruby, of course, is the gem that gives off a color of red. Curious, I must say. \n And now, let\'s move onto Ruby. \n I guess I don\'t exactly like Ruby (underestimation of the year, I admit). She is a bit too innocent and not as clever as I would like her to be. (But she technically isn\'t a Green, soo...). Anyway, I thought after a person experiences so much hardship, she/he would be a bit more careful. No one sleeps very easy at night. I know I don\'t. After a freaking earthquake, I\'m as scared as a cat in the rain. One false sign of it, and I\'m running out of the door. The thing is... I remember things like that, and I will not want to experience it again. So I think Ruby would be much less trusting (which is perhaps an aspect of her character that makes me question her very existence). Plus... where is her eyes? \n I mean, where is her eyes? Or her gut? \n Anyway, I think I should end this review before I really start ranting with crass words. The Darkest Minds is not for me, and I really don\'t enjoy it (or writing this review). \n Rating: One out of Five'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

It was a pretty good book with the exception of one rather glaring issue--Ruby. \n Ruby was such a hot and cold character; one moment you would admire her courage and intelligence yet the next her pushover attitude might make you want to yank your--or her--hair out. Although some may see her bravery mixed with bouts of cowardice as something that made her more \'real\', I found the clash of personality traits too inconsistent and jumbled, and was left grasping at wisps of random characteristics, wondering who exactly is Ruby? \n Moreover, I hated how she let one particular character dictate what she should do because I knew that particular character was bad news from the start--and I\'m sure I\'m not the only one who guessed it right. On the bright side, the decisions Ruby made at the end of the book were very redeeming. It gave me some newfound hope that maybe--just maybe--she could live up to her full potential in the following books. \n Apart from the problem of an unsatisfying protagonist, The Darkest Minds had been an interesting and adventurous read. Following Ruby, Liam, Chubs and Zu on their journey to find East River had been exhilarating and the abundant dangers, I wished I had been right there in their midst! The bond between the four of them was also extremely well-developed. Although they had not been fast friends, specifically Ruby and Chubs, it was lovely watching their friendships grow as they learn to trust and count on one another. Admittedly, the camaraderie depicted here was one of the most touching I\'ve read of! \n Each of the other major characters were wonderfully colorful too. Liam: the trusting and kind leader. Chubs: the skeptical, intelligent, annoying--but fondly so--one, sort of like a mom. And Zu: the shy little girl who\'s like a beacon of hope to everyone else. They might all be damaged in some way due to the world they lived in but seeing that such a hard life had not broken them was both impressive and inspiring. Especially Liam, who can still be cheery, positive and selfless in spite of the atrocities he had witnessed. \n As for the world-building, it was okay; polished but not very believable. Or well, it would remain rather unbelievable until we find out the cause of Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (IAAN), the disease in the novel which killed off most of America\'s children and left the surviving ones with various types of special abilities. And no, the cause will not be revealed in this first book so we have to wait (not-so-patiently). \n To sum it up, The Darkest Minds had been a really enjoyable read and regardless of the issues I had with it, the way it had concluded was beautiful, albeit heartbreaking. I loved how it showed Ruby has learned from the experiences she was put through and hinted at a much more proactive and strong protagonist in the next installment. Honestly though, I might\'ve liked the whole book better if I\'d had the time to read it within a fewer number of days and not been so occupied with school assignments. \n P.S. There\'s a part in the book where Ruby sees a vandalism which only wrote ""Matthew 19:14"" and nothing else. For those of you who don\'t have a Bible, I\'ve searched up the verse for you: \n Jesus said, ""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.""'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

Plus, it\'s too true. \n Fun Author Fact \n Malinda Lo is a rockstar and does a lot (A LOT) about queerness in YA. For the past few years, she\'s pulled together all the numbers she can on published books with queer characters to show how representation is lacking. Here is her post for 2014. \n Is this worth a book hangover? \n I think so - it\'s a fun adventure and the romance is perfect - a slow burn with lots of feeling behind it so when you finally get there, it\'s super satisfying.

Our two queer POV heroines share a quest to restore the natural balance of their kingdom, but maintain very different stances on duty, learning, ""home,"" and goals for the future. Taisin has to reach her full potential, and decide whether her teachers are an absolute authority or just a starting point; Kaede discovers that musle memory, physical discipline, and a sharp blade can trump meditation when it comes to saving the day. The world is well-drawn, the I Ching-based magic is satisfyingly logical, and the monsters are a perfect mix of horrifying or tragic, mindless or far too self-aware. \n The plot won\'t be new to most American or Western European readers - save the kingdom from the disruptive ecological effect of an ice queen! as seen in Andersen, Narnia, Jones\' Tough Guide to Fairyland, ""Frozen,"" etc.! - but the characters have an explicitly Chinese view of the situation. Irish fairy favorites - the Sidhe and the Wild Hunt - become the largely unknown Xi and a bunch of pale folks with bows and horses. Celtic imagery and Gaelic script get assessed by our protagonists as ""strange"" and ""unreadable.""

I listened to this one on audio, provided by Brilliance Audio and both the writing and the narration were excellent. There\'s so much to love about this book. Children named after book characters, a coming out story, a family tragedy and grief to deal with, and a hopeful ending that ""all will be well."" Different, but well. Accidental deaths always draw blame and guilt and Knowles handles this perfectly. The recovery time is a bit compressed due to the limitations of a novel, but the stages of grief are there. I especially like the repeated assurance of ""It\'s no one\'s fault"" that doubles as a subtle reassurance about Holden\'s homosexuality. It is just is. No one is to blame.

The first half is very good too, mostly dealing with the main character Fern\'s 14-year-old brother Holden being gay and everyone in his family kind of knowing but Holden not wanting to talk about it. Fern (who\'s 12) is the closest to her brother and has a pretty kick-ass but scary day when she sits at the back of the bus and realizes what the bullying is like for her brother at school (including a nasty school bus driver who supports the bullies!). Fern\'s dealing with some of her own stuff too: starting middle school, trying to sort out what her feelings for her guy best friend are, finding out where her place in her big family is, feeling invisible and underappreciated. \n All the characters in this family are lovingly fleshed out: Sara, the oldest at 19 who\'s a Deadhead wannabe with dreads who tells it like it is and sometimes offers truths that are a little too harsh; Mom, who\'s an old hippie who cooks vegetarian food and escapes to her meditation room above the family restaurant when things get too crazy; Dad, who\'s super keen (embarassingly so) on improving his restaurant, dragging his kids and wife along for humiliation in the form of cheesy ads featuring the family; Holden, 14 and angsty and in the closet, storming out whenever he can\'t take his family but also fiercely protective of his younger sister and super into fashion; Fern, 12, feeling like she\'s kind of caught between childhood and teenagehood, feeling undervalued and invisible in her big family but underneath super brave and loving; Charlie, 3 and the ""accidental"" baby who is a bit of a terror, always sticky and smelly and wanting everyone to play with him when they\'re all really busy and have better things to do. \n So you get to know all these characters so well, and their family dynamic, and then halfway through the book Charlie dies. I knew something like this happened in the book (probably from reading a review at some point) but I was still reeling after it happened. I can\'t imagine what it would be like to read this if you had no idea there was going to be a death. As I already said, it\'s just heartbreaking and made me cry over and over again. Knowles does such an amazing job of depicting how each member of the family deals with their grief. We see everything from Fern\'s perspective, who at times doesn\'t understand the different ways that everyone is trying to cope; she\'s especially devastated at how her mother emotionally disappears just when Fern and her siblings really need her. She\'s also racked with guilt over having been watching Charlie when the accident that leads to his death happens, convinced it is her fault. \n Slowly, slowly at the end of the book, their family begins to pick up their lives again, and Knowles ultimately leaves the reader with the idea that while things will never be the same again, there is hope and happiness in the future of their family (including for Holden, who eventually comes out to his family and goes to the school dance with another boy!). And then if you\'re like me you cry again at the end, but happy tears this time.'",4.11,"Starting middle school brings all the usual challenges -- until the unthinkable happens, and Fern and her family must find a way to heal.

Twelve-year-old Fern feels invisible. It seems as though everyone in her family has better things to do than pay attention to her: Mom (when she's not meditating) helps Dad run the family restaurant; Sarah is taking a gap year after high school; and Holden pretends that Mom and Dad and everyone else doesn't know he's gay, even as he fends off bullies at school. Then there's Charlie: three years old, a ""surprise"" baby, the center of everyone's world. He's devoted to Fern, but he's annoying, too, always getting his way, always dirty, always commanding attention. If it wasn't for Ran, Fern's calm and positive best friend, there'd be nowhere to turn. Ran's mantra, ""All will be well,"" is soothing in a way that nothing else seems to be. And when Ran says it, Fern can almost believe it's true.

With that said, this product I believe is intended for children 10 and up. I have an almost 9 year old who is a very advanced reader and I do not believe this would be an appropriate book for her. Way to much on the romance side of things regarding Fang Dylan and Max. \n With that out of the way, while I would worry about how appropriate it was for a young audience, I personally really enjoyed it. This book is great closure. I love that in the end I was not left with a plethora of unanswered questions. One of the biggest reveals for me was the identity of The Voice, and I am so happy this was included. \n Max stayed true to character. She showed her continued softening, but never lost her ability to lead. She remains a strong heroine, which is very welcome. She wasn't quite as headstrong and stubborn as she has been in the past, there is definite character growth where she is concerned. Her choice of priorities in the end was admirable and believable, and really helped sell me on the story. \n At times I did think it was a bit to cliche, injuries were just to inconsequential, answers were a little to easy, but it is after all a children's book. \n The pacing was fantastic. The length did leave a bit to be desired, but again, I am an adult reader. I don't think the length would have annoyed me as much had the last 13% of the product not been a preview of a different book. It really makes it deceptive about the true length of the book you are buying. The actual story stops on 344, not 380.

I was trying to figure out how it looked like, and frankly, all I got was: \n I mean, is that the end of the world? \'Cause all I gathered was a big, bright, searing light -- and a really hot one at that -- plus a few catastrophes here and there. The big tsunami thing reminded me of the movie 2012. \n So, all in all, despite all the initial drama, heartache and even more drama (yes, I know that I am redundant), I give it a 5 out of 5 (and yes, I know I should use words if I should stick to being a stickler for grammar). I love James Patterson, I love (not ""loved"", because that would mean that I still don\'t love it, even though it has ended) the Maximum Ride series and I am excited for the new book series (?) that he\'s writing about.

Everyone constantly says it\'s ""Not a zombie book,"" and I can wholeheartedly agree with that now - at the end it felt much more akin to Susan Beth Pfeffer\'s Life As We Knew It or Meg Rosoff\'s How I Live Now - survival in spite of zombies. \n The beginning half of the book is quite different from the last half, as the setting drastically changes partway through due to circumstances the characters experience. I enjoyed the second half more than the first, but this could also be because by the second half you are much more invested in the characters. \n My biggest gripe with The Forest of Hands and Teeth is that often days or weeks would go by with no mention, and I prefer to have a continuous story. Though I suppose having a few weeks of living with no extraordinary events is realistic - it just feels less likely to me in a dystopian setting. \n I\'m interested to see how the second and third books go. I\'ve had readers tell me they enjoyed the second (Dead Tossed Waves) many more times than the first, with the third (Dark and Hollow Places) being a perfect ending to the trilogy - this is very exciting to me because I quite enjoyed The Forest of Hands and Teeth as it was. \n Very recommended to Susan Beth Pfeffer fans - or, if you\'ve read The Forest of Hands and Teeth, I recommend you try the Pfeffer books. Survival based and you get that eerie, frantic feeling with both. Good start to the series!'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best.

One of the reviews that I read months later said that Twilight signaled the new ""in"" subject in YA - vampires. They were the ""new zombies;"" and zombies were ""out."" \n I had never read any books about zombies, for two reasons. First, Robin McKinley has never written a book about them. Second, I am a wimp. A big one. I saw ""Poltergeist"" when I was 19 and I still have nightmares about it. Forget ""Thriller."" Undead doesn\'t do it for me. \n Keep that in mind, then, when I say that I almost couldn\'t finish The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan. Her writing is intelligent and sure-handed. Her descriptions are vivid without being verbose. Her zombies jump off the page and try to eat my brains. Oh, wait. \n The Forest of Hands and Teeth introduces Mary, a teenager who lives in a dystopian future. The rules set by the Sisterhood are clear - stay inside the gates, away from the undead who run free in the forest. But when tragedy strikes and Mary must join the Sisterhood against her will, she finds herself thinking about what might lie beyond the fence. \n I really want to be able to tell you more, but then I would have to feed you to the undead. Instead, watch this trailer: \n Truly, I am lucky beyond lucky to even have gotten my hands on the ARC of this book. The fantastic Sharon at ""Sharon Loves Books and Cats"" chose me as the default winner of her early January giveaway. The day I received the ARC in the mail, I put the kids to bed and then stayed up late to read the whole gosh darn book. And then I stayed up late because I couldn\'t sleep. I\'m not sure how to eruditely say, ""I was creeped out."" \n Having said that, however, I also want to say that Forest of Hands and Teeth was not a slasher brain candy kind of story. Ryan\'s characterization of Mary shows the depth of a perceptive, complex teenager. Her relationships are not easily defined, and her penchant for questioning authority puts her in frightening situations. \n The only hesitation I have in totally recommending this book is its ambiguity concerning religion and spirituality. This is an occupational hazard and if I ever wrote a book Ryan would probably say the same thing about my grasp of law. The Sisterhood which governs the village seems to take its reference from the sisterhood of Catholic nuns; the Bible Mary is forced to read seems to be the Christian Bible. Because the purpose and power of the Sisterhood are so roundly questioned in the first part of the book, I expected religion and spirituality to be a theme throughout. Mary expresses her disdain for this religion in which she\'s been brought up, but there\'s no further development. Since my field is religion, I would have liked to have seen these thread continue throughout the story. \n Then again, maybe Ryan will explore it more in the second installment of Mary\'s story, which will be released in 2010. And maybe by then I\'ll have desensitized enough that I can enjoy Ryan\'s excellent writing without resenting the fact that she writes well enough to bring zombies into my bedroom. \n So. I highly rate this book, despite the fact that I do not consider zombie stories pleasant reading. Whoever said zombies were ""out"" is in for a shock when Forest of Hands and Teeth is released March 10. I\'ll leave it up to you whether it\'s a pleasant shock or not, but thanks to Carrie Ryan, zombies are definitely back ""in.""'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

I hoped and wished that Mary would just DIE. \n The concept of the book is entirely unoriginal and seems to have been molded around M. Night Shamalamawhatever\'s ""The Village"". While the rest of the world seemed to hate that movie, I liked the idea and enjoyed the movie pretty much. I got that vibe while reading this book and I could have lived with--and even enjoyed--this book in all its unoriginal glory. \n BUT.... \n The author managed to create the most unlikeable character ever in this novel, and lucky for us readers, it was our boring, whiney, bipolar, selfish, stupid protagonist, Mary. There are so many things terribly painful about this book, that I\'m sure they\'ve already been written in reviews before, but I have to touch on a few. \n 1. Point of View. The author didn\'t do anyone any favors by writing in first person present point of view. Instead of an entertaining story, we get pages and pages and pages of what\'s going on inside Mary\'s head. First person present can work extremely well, but there wasn\'t enough actually going on in the story, so instead, we get front row seats to the spectacle that is Mary\'s inner thoughts. And all this chick thinks about is Travis, the ocean, her mother, and other things masked as philosophical ponderings. \n 2. Mary is a psycho. This chick has issues. First of all, dumb as rocks and though she constantly wonders what is outside the fence and what life used to hold, she is completely oblivious to things around her. She is the most selfish protagonist I\'ve ever seen (and I heard people call Katniss selfish... they should check this hot mess out!). All she thought about was Travis and the ocean, and was either hurting those people around her who\'ve been there for her since childhood, or putting everyone in danger all the time just so she could have her way. I found it impossible to root for her, and it broke my heart to find out that the series continues, because it means she won\'t die at the end. \n 3. Love/obsession triangle. This is not love. This is insanity, low self-esteem, bipolar mood swings, and a complete disregard for anything resembling respect. Her connection to these guys since childhood should have formed a stronger bond with them, especially since the population is so small, but there appears to be no strong connection between anyone here. Harry and Travis are brothers, and yet they show zero loyalty to one another, and betray the other without even thinking twice. Mary\'s confusing obsession with Travis is sickening, something like infatuation, but so up and down I\'m wondering where her medications are. Her ""friendship"" with Cass supposedly went back many many years, and yet she has no shame in her actions with Travis. In one sentence, she\'s describing how she can\'t live without Travis, and the next she\'s fuming over the sight of Cass and Harry, and then she\'s livid over Cass and Travis... and it never stops. This chick has major issues. This girl represents everything that I want my daughter to NOT become. I may even use this book as an example of a pathetic and embarrassing excuse for a woman (and lead character!). \n 4. Everything else. It just was terrible. I was pretty invested even up until about halfway, and had this book at around 3 stars, despite Mary\'s character flaws. I liked the concept enough. And to the author\'s credit, her writing in terms of sentence structure and flow was actually not bad. But then it all went terribly downhill. \n Towards the end of the book I was really hoping that Jed would get Cass and Jacob out and safe. Cass had an epiphany at the end and I liked her mothering instincts actually. That is about the only thing believable and likeable about this book. \n I skimmed the last 20 pages or so of the book since I was nodding off, and found myself jumping with joy when I finally closed the book and could say I was done. I have never read Twilight, but after watching the movies, I see a similarity in pathetic characteristic between Bella and this Mary chick. I don\'t want to read or see pathetic. It\'s disgusting and uninteresting. I won\'t be reading the others, and I am going to immediately pick up something else and try and flush this waste of time out of my brain.'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

Most unwise. This book is gripping. This book you cannot put down. Let\'s just admit I read this book in one day, finishing late into the night. \n This is young adult zombie book, which may make you want to run for the hills, but I found it entertaining. The story is a cross between Dawn of the Dead and the movie The Village. It centers around Mary, who has grown up knowing only her village, surrounded by fences and with the hum of the undead moaning around the forest. Her village is presided over by the Sisterhood, a shadowy religious group which keeps everyone in line. The books begins with Mary\'s mother, distraught over the loss of her husband to the Forest of Hands and Teeth, being lost to the zombies. Don\'t slap me, this really isn\'t a spoiler as it happens on page one and starts the book off. Mary is thrown into different difficult situations until the unthinkable occurs and she is off on her own trying to survive in the terrifying forest. \n Positives for me was the suspense in the book. It was gripping and well-done. The sisterhood is shadowy and scary, and weird things are going on everywhere. It is easy to lose yourself in this world, and the author makes it easy to suspend your disbelief. \n I could not quite give it a complete 5-star because I had a few frustrations. The book is written from Mary\'s point of view only, which is not necessarily a bad thing normally, except that here you just cannot figure out what the heck is going on. It\'s a little like watching Lost, I flipping loved the show but there were just too many unanswered questions. I could list a whole bunch of ""Why did....s"" here but it would be too spoilery so I won\'t. Many things are unknown and never answered. \n I have read in the reviews here that some people find Mary\'s character unlikeable and frustrating. I have to defend her. The kid is seriously damaged and has a freaky upbringing. She is completely surrounded by walking dead people, the Sisterhood is running the show, and her family is pretty much dysfunctional or dead. She is not in control of her life in any way, and she experiences terrible tragedy after terrible tragedy. And yet everyone wants her to perkily skip through the forest and blow kisses at the dead people and jump into the first cute guy\'s arms that comes her way. This to me would have been completely unrealistic. Maybe because it\'s a YA novel people expect it to be lovey dovey and Twilight-ish. But it\'s not that kind of story. I\'m frankly impressed the girl can walk in a straight line. \n If you want a fun, consuming read that will scare the pants off you, this is the one. It\'s kind of like renting a fun ghost movie or something. I highly recommend it. I should also say the book is a bit sad and heavy, but you know, zombie apocalypses don\'t usually go so well. \n Apparently this is the first book in a trilogy, so whenever I don\'t have to get up early the next day I\'ll read the next one!'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

The title is wonderful and poetic, and (machine knit sweater aside) the cover is beautiful. After the book came out the reviews made me hesitant to read it, but when it was put into my hands with the instructions of 'read it' I didn't see a reason not too. \n As it turns out it wasn't bad. It moves along at a smart clip, has a interesting world that's chilling at its best, and strong emotional scenes early on. On the downside there are lots of little details that threw me out of the story, including the characters just plain acting dumb. The isn't so much a plot as there is a series of events - the end of the book could be the end of a chapter - and the major questions (what caused the zombies? what secrets are the sisterhood hiding? which love interest will she choose?) are either unanswered, or avoided completely by taking the choice out of the heroine's hands. Parts of it reminded me of The Village. \n At about the halfway point I stopped caring what would happen, mostly because it was pretty obvious how things would unfold. I keep going because the pace was quick and smooth and it wasn't any effort to finish the book. Probably the thing that dragged down the novel the most for me was all the unnecessary relationship drama, which was the actual focus of the story. It made the zombies seem less threatening that the heroine was more concerned about who loved whom. \n All in all it isn't bad, but it was disappointing. Perhaps made more disappointing because of how promising it was and how well it was hyped. In context of a debut book I'm willing to be forgiving. I won't be seeking out the sequel, but if it's handed to me like this one was I'd read it.""",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best.

Then people did this, people did that... \n It just started lacking what I always look for in a story -- captivating writing. \n Admittedly, I never expected any humor from it (sometimes, that\'s why I read a book, just to know how witty the characters are), but the characters are just...BLAND. \n Cassandra, her best friend, was badly dealt with. Harry was...Harry. Boring. Travis was also equally boring and surprisingly WEAK. Jed was an asswipe. They make me all gag. \n And Mary? Wow, was she HORRIBLE. She\'s only driven by a childish dream and, really, it\'s annoying. There are people who listen to her because she thinks she knows things. She leads people on and leaves them in danger. Most of the time, all I ever read about her thinking about is, ""Look, something happened to Gabrielle, I like Travis and I want to go to the beach."" I truly hate her. \n She also thinks about what the Roman numerals mean, but only sporadically. I\'m just wondering -- isn\'t that supposed to be a big thing? \n The only people are like: \n 1) Gabrielle - she makes a kick-ass zombie \n 2) Sister Tabitha - although she\'s creepy, she DOES manage to hold off zombie Gabrielle and a bunch of other zombies \n 3) Argos - he\'s not technically human, but I just love dogs \n 4) the guy Mary meets when she washes up somewhere - he\'s cool because he kills zombies with a spade \n 5) Beth - I just feel sorry for her \n I mean, the ending isn\'t that good either. I don\'t know what happens to Cass and Co., I don\'t know what the Roman numerals mean, I don\'t know what she feels about this Outside world (SHE DOESN\'T ASK QUESTIONS, WTF; I mean, if I was her, I\'d be pretty curious as to the HOW, WHY, WHEN AND WHERE of things). \n I just like the parts with the zombies in it.'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

I find it incredibly hard to relate to her, since even in my grief I never did anything completely stupid or life endangering. \n Mary is the protagonist and she has never seen the ocean. Her desire to see the ocean due to her mother\'s stories about the ocean... are basically 90% of what motivates her in the story. There isn\'t anything wrong with that, but I think perhaps her character is meant to be mentally unstable. She lost her mother and father to zombies, her brother treated her like garbage and was all ""GET THEE TO A NUNNERY"" on her ass, AND to top it all off her best friend, Cass, was going to marry the love of her life, Travis. \n The story loses a clear focus as it seems not enough attention was given to the elements in the first half of the book. What was the sisterhood up to? Why did they make a super zombie and then let it into the wild? Why did the village with reinforced doors succumb to the zombie attack so quickly? Why were the two buildings inhabited empty with no zeds to be found laying in wait? There are plenty of other plot holes, but these were the biggest to me. \n The writing is great otherwise. The first 80-90 pages were fantastic too. I really believed this character and her motivations and I could accept her behavior even if I didn\'t like it. I just think there wasn\'t enough explanation or conclusion about the things mentioned above. \n All in all, this is worth reading because it tackles zombies in a ""The Village"" kind of way.

For her desire to see the ocean, a need so deep it ends up killing(probably, although we don't get to see all of it) all her friends and her brother. \n She's careless, weak and borderline suicidal a couple of times. \n Next off we have the love triangle, without which the book could've done so much better, mainly because it didn't even feel real. We have two, seemingly, nice guys who love her more than anything, with no real explanation or apparent reason as to why. \n I cared more about what happened to them than I did about our so called heroine. And that's something because even though this book is not just about her, but about their group trying to survive, I didn't feel like we ever got to know them. \n Most of the time, it felt the rest of the characters were just written in as either in support of her mad desires and dreams or there to shut them down. Like it never really mattered what happened to them in the end. \n Also, so many questions are left unanswered. Who were They? What was this disease that made the zombies? What was up with the Sisterhood and all the secrets they kept? Why? Etc. Almost like by the end of the book, the author forgot about them and focused solely on getting Mary to the beach, plot be damned! \n Still, I gave this book 3 stars for the brilliant way in which it describes this zombie apocalypse and Mary's craziness.""",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent.

At first I was not going to read it because I thought it was a book based in past times and too dull. Whoa..nope it\'s not dull. These poor people never get a moment to rest! There is a BAM almost every time they close their eyes! \n So, I do have one HUGE issue with this book, and it appears it is why people call Mary all kinds of names, including selfish. Which I find VERY odd! OK, so I am a romantic at heart- I LOVE love! I am the go to the highest mountain, do anything for those I love, people or animals type of person- I am VERY unselfish in life and in love. I give it 120%! OK- now back to the book! ;) What I cannot understand is why a woman author is having a poor girl say she is SELFISH for wanting something more than just a man??? I mean..what one of us would be fulfilled if all we did was have a man and stay at home??? Sure some women, that IS their dream- But it is usually the kids that are their dream- not always the man- I am cool with that! But I know many housewives who are miserable and unfulfilled- Our world is about more than just raising kids. We are supposed to help others. So I have a lot of dreams. As do many..it doesn\'t mean I don\'t want love- That was one of my dreams as well :) But I am not just going to sit at home and not want to fulfill other dreams- When we have our own lives that makes us BETTER and it makes us love even more- It doesn\'t take away! When we have our own goals, dreams etc and are our own person..how does that mean we don\'t love someone? A man or a woman shouldn\'t be our only goal in life! HA! How is it selfish that Mary had a dream? IT IS however selfish that those men wanted her to devote her life to them and didn\'t want to let her have her dream. Wow...seriously. Are we living in the BC times?lol. I rescue animals, want to help women and children etc etc etc. And I would never be with a man who wanted me to just stay home and do nothing with my life- I want to do something big in this world- And I expect a man who loved me would want to be by my side in it and help me pursue my dreams- Not hold me back! THAT is LOVE! Helping someone reach their dreams- It doesn\'t take away from your love for them at ALL! But it does if you are telling someone to give up their dreams- I am not talking about some workaholic type either- But many of us have dreams- Why can\'t we have love and a life too?? \n Mary isn\'t selfish- She just wants a life beyond love- Beyond get up, play with my child, go to bed. How is that selfish? Those men are selfish- They wanted her to give up on her dream. THAT is selfish. It was making me want to drive my nails down the wall to keep hearing the men say ""I should be enough"" What??? Well that isn\'t love if you just expect someone to have no life and focus 100% on you. That is unhealthy. Someone can still love you like twilight love but also have a life and accomplish things too. It just helps you love MORE even because you are getting to have a life and fulfill your dreams too. Any man or woman who really loves you will be HELPING you and wanting you to reach your dreams and live a fulfilled LIFE! That is REAL LOVE. Selfish love was what the men in this book were doing- Expecting her to focus 100% on them and have no dreams outside of them. Ridiculous! If THEY loved HER they would have been trying to help her reach her dreams, not trying to guilt her into having none. They knew this was her dream. Why on earth can\'t she have love and life??? Love and her dreams and goals? Silly! \n OK so...!!!LOL! This book was great. Beyond the one basis that I truly despised about life and love- The book was good and I was SO disappointing and shattered that the second book did not leave off where this one did :((( I would have liked to see what happened to some others in the book and if she went back for them etc- But I guess maybe it does have some parts in the dead tossed waves- I will probably read it tonight but I couldn\'t last night. I was too disappointed it didn\'t leave off in Mary\'s story :( And please lord let her have found a man who is unselfish. She is not- She never left anyone behind and helped everyone even if it meant sacrificing herself- She is NOT selfish- She made sure to help everyone and get them safe and she never wanted Travis or anyone put in danger or to sacrifice themselves. She was not selfish just because she wanted a life outside of love!!'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve.

For the umpteenth time her mother and her move again, this time to a new flat in London and she isn't happy about it at all because she started putting down roots the last time they moved. In fact, her best friend Olivia, comes with them to help them out for the next two weeks and that is pretty much the only thing that Gwen is happy for. But eventually she knows that Liv is going back home and she'll be stuck here with her mother who believes that the fairy mural painted in the second bedroom in their new flat is real and that they are watching her. \n On the first night, Gwen is awoken by something moving in the shadows and making noises, she thinks it's just a draft of some sort, until a hand clutches over her mouth and lifts her up and out of her room. After a freaky light show, some flying, and possibly a cannon fight, Gwen finds herself falling into water and losing consciousness.

Authors need to retain just enough of the original story to make readers feel comfortable and familiar with the story, but they need to add enough spin to their version to make it their own. After all, it is supposed to be a retelling, not a rehash of the 'same old, same old'. Lisa Maxwell's Unhooked, a retelling of Peter Pan of sorts, does a great job with finding this very delicate balance between the two must-have elements in a fairytale retelling. \n Unhooked grabs readers and takes them away to a very dark, gritty Neverland. Here you find magic, adventure, and the ability to fly around, but there is an undertone of darkness. And of course, living on the island comes with a cost - you start to lose yourself, your past memories, and pretty much you have to sacrifice everything from your former life. \n Upon starting Unhooked, there is a slight feeling of confusion. Maxwell doesn't necessarily throw readers into the action, but there are a lot of secrets and untold stories. This gives readers the sense that they are missing something or something was left out. It wasn't left out, as all things slowly start to come together, but it can be very confusing especially if you are expecting a complete Peter Pan knockoff. \n Maxwell adds several different twists to the story to make it her own. There are dark faeries, a battle for the island, Pan is not at all like the Disney version (even though he tries to act that way at first), and Hook has a very interesting backstory that forces readers to look at him in a completely different light. \n I really enjoyed the twist Maxwell added to the Peter Pan story. After the initial slow/confusing start, the story really took on a life of its own. It was fun to see how Maxwell took some of the original fairytale/Disney version and twisted it to give it a unique angle. \n However, despite this novel being what I would consider a fairytale retelling done right, it is not without its flaws. Gwen, our main heroine and who is responsible for telling us the story, is a bit frustrating as a character. There were times when she would act incredibly strong and independent, but then just as quickly she'd be a wishy-washy character who couldn't make up her mind. It almost seemed like if she was supposed to think for her own, she wouldn't and times where she didn't need to think for herself she'd start exerting some level of control over the situation. \n I personally would have liked to see Gwen grow a bit more as a character. Unfortunately, she seemed to just glide through the story and let other people/situations tell her what to do. \n Another slight flaw was the world-building. Neverland was this mysterious dark world and while readers are given a glimpse into that world, it never really felt like it was enough. I would have loved the romance aspect toned down and more focus on Neverland. \n That leads me to the romance. Unhooked had unexpected romance thrown into it. While I understand the importance of romance, it seemed forced and almost overtook the story. There is a budding romance between Gwen and Hook, it almost bordered on the insta-love. Then there was this odd romance between Pan and Olivia (Gwen's best friend who got taken to Neverland). Olivia would get jealous of Gwen whenever Pan looked/talked to Gwen. \n The romance does play a role in the plot and adds an element to the story, but I would have liked to see more time devoted to character development (either Gwen or Pan) or developing the world of Neverland. \n Even though it is not a perfect book, it is a satisfying read. Upon completion of Unhooked, I felt like I read a solid, complete standalone novel. There were certainly enough twists and turns to keep me entertained and reading, and the ending wasn't fully what I thought would happen, but I wasn't disappointed in it. \n I would recommend Unhooked to those who enjoyed Peter Pan and are looking for a new spin on the old classic story. Those who are looking for a quick fantasy read will also enjoy it too, as will anyone who likes fairytale retellings.""",3.57,"For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home--all because her mother believes that monsters are hunting them.

I've tried starting a number of books such as The Lost Boys and Second Star but I've never been able to get past a few chapters. Unhooked, on the other hand, just got me hooked (no pun intended). \n Seeing as I've never finished a Peter Pan retelling before, I'm not fit to judge the originality of this retelling. However, as I was reading it, it felt very unique. What I really loved about this novel is how the roles they (Pan, Hook and the others) play are not so black and white. Even until the end, there were still surprises, and I just loved that in this book. There are times when that gets annoying, but the author made it work with this one. Plus points, too because the author was able to make it work in a retelling in which we are supposed to know what happens. \n Despite my bad history with Peter Pan retellings, I'm just so glad that I felt so compelled to request this, because it's one of the most enjoyable retellings I've read in a while. It was almost perfect. And ahh, the romance! There was so much tension and so much feels, and I just loved it! Gosh, I don't even know how to put all my feelings into words about how amazing the romance in this book is! \n Through this novel, Lisa Maxwell has created a whole new Neverland where everything is grey and nothing is black or white. Clever, gripping and moving, this one is truly worth the read!""",3.57,"For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home--all because her mother believes that monsters are hunting them.

There was a time when geeky, squeaky-clean Max Kilgore would never lie or steal or even think about murder. Then he accidentally unearths a devil, and Max's choices are no longer his own. The big red guy has a penchant for couch surfing and junk food--and you should never underestimate evil on a sugar high.

Welcome to the land of Adarlan where the world has been stripped of all its magic and the word magic has been banned by the king. Over there is the city of Endovier that also contains a labor camp where all the prisoners who haven't been killed are sent to work the salt mines. In this camp is a girl of eighteen who is notorious. Her name is Celaena, but others just call her Adarlan's Assassin. It's for this girl that the Crown Prince of Adarlan - Dorian - and the Captain of his guard - Chaol - come to Endovier for. Dorian's father is hosting a competition for someone to become the King's Champion and Dorian wants to sponsor her. He believes that she can win if what he's heard about her is true. Happy for the chance at freedom she accepts. \n Dorian takes her to the glass palace where she meets the other competitors, most of whom are fellow criminals, but instead of going by her name Dorian and Chaol introduce her as Lady Lillian a jewel thief from the neighboring country. They don't want to draw too much attention to her. However, it doesn't quite matter because even though there are Tests prepared to eliminate those who aren't worthy, there are mysterious murders too. The day of a new Test, a body of competitor is found and Chaol is having a hard time trying to figure out what is going on. Celaena starts to pick up on some of the mystery and does her own investigation but what she discovers she can't believe. How is it possible for this sort of magic to still exist? \n She doesn't know and wants to find out but there are people out there - spies, her fellow competitors, those close to the king - who are bent on making sure that she doesn't find out until it's too late.""",4.23,"Meet Celaena Sardothien.

In the dark, filthy salt mines of Endovier, an eighteen-year-old girl is serving a life sentence. She is a trained assassin, the best of her kind, but she made a fatal mistake: she got caught.
Young Captain Westfall offers her a deal: her freedom in return for one huge sacrifice.

After a year of brutal treatment, she is offered an opportunity for freedom by none other than Prince Dorian: if she can win a competition to become the King\'s Champion, and serve him for four years, she will have her freedom. Killing, even for the king who crushed her people, is better than being whipped and beaten, so Celaena takes the chance. As she regains her strength and tries not to appear too intimidating to the other competitors (not than most of them take a girl seriously anyway), she discovers an evil plot in the glass palace. Someone is using forbidden magic to kill off the competitors. Is it scheming Kaltain who wants the prince for herself? Is it the foreign princess Nehemia? Perhaps it is the king himself, or the top competitor, Cain? Celaena isn\'t sure about that. What she is sure about is falling for both Prince Dorian and the man assigned to guard her, Chaol. \n First off, let me just say that I had the song ""Heart of Glass"" stuck in my head for the duration of reading this book. \n Second, I did not expect to like this as much as I did! I\'m not a huge fan of fantasy, but I liked this female assassin immediately. Celaena was a firecracker to be sure, and deadly, but she also actually cared about people. I didn\'t much expect to like either the prince or Chaol at first, and now I\'m about as torn as Celaena, and generally I dislike love triangles... I also liked that Celaena had other friendships throughout that weren\'t part of her love triangle. The world building somehow didn\'t interfere with the plot (no giant info dumps!) and I\'m very curious about the rebellion and the Wyrdmarks.

If anything, I love it even more each time. \n Dessen at her absolute best. \n Updated July 2015 \n The most common complaint about Sarah Dessen is her classic formulaic stories that have become, well, her trademark. Her signature novel, usually a coming of age story, consists of: family dysfunction, a dash of romance and self discovery, often over the course of a summer, through the perspective of a likeable and relatable heroine. BOOM--Classic Dessen. \n While I can certainly agree to an extent with the above, all the above is also everything I enjoy in a YA novel, so no complaints here from a forever loyal Dessen fangirl. \n But to everyone who believes that all her novels are the same, every book a repetition of the last, well, I don\'t think you\'ve read this one. I appreciate every MC she\'s given us thus far, however similar or interchangeable you may find them, but Remy is nothing at all like the others. \n Like I said, I\'m a huge Dessen fan and I love every work of hers published, but I truly believe this is Sarah at her absolute best. Remy is complicated, stubborn, cynical, what many would even call ""unlikeable"" which is what makes her my favorite of all. Not only does her authenticity ring true on every page and in every bit of dialogue, but there\'s just something about the way the story is written that makes it stand out amongst the others. Dessen just has a knack for off-handedly describing something so trivial in such an insightful way that hits you, resonating so deeply with you, you find yourself bookmarking pages and passages or committing the wording to memory because you realize it\'s a feeling you\'ve always felt but could never put into words or never even thought to put into words before. \n The romance is also unconventional, especially by Dessen standards. The love interest here is Remy\'s total opposite; he\'s quirky, easygoing, silly and lovable. Above all, he\'s a musician aka a deal breaker. In most novels even outside of Dessen\'s, we\'re given a totally perfect boy. Tall, dark and handsome; the ideal. And while I love to swoon over a Ken as much as the next girl, there\'s just something enticing and exciting and heartwarming about watching a reluctant girl fall in love with the person she least expects. (I\'m all for that trope ANY day!) \n I reread This Lullaby annually, preferably in the summer and will continue to do so, however, this year marked ten years since I discovered this book. I was fourteen years old and instead of getting an allowance like most of my friends would, my mom would take my brother and I to the mall or wherever and let us pick out something for our good behavior (yeah right) or mostly so we would keep occupied and stop nagging 24/7. Usually I\'d go with those 3-pack magazine bundles of Tiger Beat, J-14 and Teen Bop along with a CD (I wanted to be a magazine editor at this time) but after browsing the magazine and music section at Target, I was annoyed I had already gotten every anticipated new release earlier that month. So I wandered into the book section. I\'d always been a reader, but junior high is evil and, well, I hadn\'t picked up a book in a while but something about two covers I saw on the shelf drew my attention. The first one pictured two pairs of feet on the beach, the other a hand holding a flower petal(?..idk) (YA covers have come a long way since 2005, huh?). I read the back of both and after much contemplation, I picked up This Lullaby. It didn\'t occur to me until a few years later as I was thinking back on that off-chance of me wandering in the book isle that I probably could have gotten both. (My mom def wouldn\'t have discouraged it.) And, well, the rest is history. \n This might seem stupid or kind of weird to some of you, but this is one of the most vivid moments in my life that I can recall and that I\'m thankful for--unknowingly picking up what would become my absolute favorite book for the very first time. It\'s a good memory to have anyway. Had I picked up Someone Like You instead that day, I undoubtedly still would have discovered and loved This Lullaby but the fact that I hadn\'t and that by chance (or fate), this was my first Dessen book, the introduction to a crucial part of my adolescence, makes it all the more special to me. \n I didn\'t set out to write this much (embarrassing!), I only figured I\'d write not necessarily a review, but jot some of my thoughts and feelings down for this book, something to commemorate this story that has been with me from my fourteen years to my now (almost) twenty-four year old self. \n If you haven\'t read This Lullaby yet, I obviously suggest you do. If you\'re reluctant to because of previous Dessen works that weren\'t your thing, try it anyway. Who knows, it could very well end up becoming your favorite book too.'",4.03,"There is an alternate cover edition for this ISBN13 .

This one, however, didn\'t really do it for me. I still love Dessen\'s writing style and her un-preachy attitude towards teens drinking and having sex. I was even OK with Remy\'s crabbiness toward guys, since it\'s grounded in her mother\'s string of failed marriages and general flightiness. But I just didn\'t believe anything about Dexter, and worse, I didn\'t like him. He shows his feelings for Remy by being creepy, stalker-y, and immature. Literally the only thing that makes his actions OK is that he somehow ""just knows"" he and Remy are going to end up together. She tells him ""no"" over and over and he just ignores her. I hate to be the one taking the ""what are we teaching our children??"" tack, but I just cannot get behind a book whose message is ""you\'ll know when you find THE ONE because he won\'t take no for an answer."" \n I also found the whole musician dad subplot troubling. I get that allowing Dexter to sing her dad\'s song represents Remy finally yielding the most private part of herself to Dexter, but the emotional impact that that change was supposed to have never really resonated with me. \n I do like stories like this, where a crabby jaded girl learns to take risks and let herself love again.

I really like it. Very pretty. Nice contrast. You can easily tell which type of readers they are targeting. \n Catherine Linka does a great job of evoking reader\'s emotion. Honestly, I was so upset at the book that I nearly strangle its invisible neck. The book does bring up issues on feminism and other such topics like politics and anti-government. Well, not exactly anti-government. We can just say that this book is a perfect example of what happens when the government gets things wrong. Eh... Near perfect. It is not exactly perfect. Besides, there is a more peaceful way of ending these issues in the book. Uniting all the girls together and marching to Washington D.C. \n But let\'s pretend those options don\'t exist. Let\'s pretend those options don\'t exist to the point that these people, these characters, need to turn to violence. That is what A Girl Called Fearless does. \n Basically, this book turns United States into a similar place to what some countries in the Middle Eastern are like. Oh, yeah. Girls can\'t drive. Girls stay home. Girls don\'t have education. Honestly, I pretty much figured out that I\'m a feminist and that I really hate staying at home and not having an education. And I figured out that I can spend ten pages just ranting on the inequality and unfairness of the government in this book (which degrades woman to the point where they are just like cattle and property). It is as if the Woman\'s Rights Movement took a huge step backwards. \n Yeah, I\'m spending way too much time ranting on anti-feminism. Where was I? Oh, yes. The book. \n Honestly, when it comes to Avie Reveare, I just want to bang her head and shout, ""Kill them all!"" But I like her, actually. She isn\'t a strong character at first, but she grows very well. I don\'t approve very much on her love interests, but... That is a much different situation, which is not as severe as the anti-feminism movement. \n Overall, A Girl Called Fearless is a great book. You might hate a lot of the characters (because they are all against girl power), but it is entertaining. For certain. \n And there is probably going to be a lot of debate. Especially among the girls. \n Rating: Four out of Five \n -ofpaperandwords.blogspot.com'",3.83,"An Indie Next Pick!

Well, I only have given ***** to books I want to reread every five minutes and possibly copy out by hand so I tend to save my **** for books that are not simply readable but extremely excellent.) 'rock' is a good young adult book, mature, well structured, tense and nailbittingly romantic but it's not quite a masterpiece. If you want some family centered m/m lonnnnnng teen/young adult romance you are in for a treat with this sweet but never fluffy, but it isn't the place to explore the meaning of life, too (and that's cool!) \n One thing that felt kind of strange to me was Cooper's anxious behaviour, it recurred through the book and it obviously had an explanation (Cooper starts to give it when he meets Jace) that goes beyond 'a few quirks' but it's never explored further than that. I could live and in fact, I could support not naming names and foregoing labels but I found it odd that the issue was set up so neatly and then kinda left by the wayside even in times of great anxiety and stress.

Tears, laughter and pure speechlessness! \n So glad I again trusted my friends recommendation and ""Kindled the crap out of it ASAP. "" and I especially should have listened when she told me to grab the tissues! \n The story begins with a family breaking up and the kids trying to reconcile the new life they were leading and accepting a new side to their family whilst forgiving their dad in the process. If that wasn\'t emotional enough then we have the beautiful quiet rock loving Cooper discovering his true self and being strong enough to share that with his family. And what a family.... \n Coming out to his sister who just told Coop to embrace life and be himself and then to his wonderful mum. I don\'t think anyone can make it through the cookie scene without tears. ""Ill always be your biggest fan..no matter what play you make"". \n And lets have a shout out for Bert and Ernie, lovable idiots. The way they handled the realization and resulting school reaction to Cooper\'s sexuality was great. To just ignore the world and make the world a stage for Cooper was just beautiful. Friendship is acceptance and these boys displayed it wonderfully, albeit with questionable dance moves! \n Despite all this acceptance we still had to watch coop struggle through his feelings and loving Jace from afar. So many beautiful moments between them and you just wished the world would fade away so they could get it together. \n How could you not feel for these boys, watching them grow together then grow apart was heartbreaking. ""I\'ll be your rock"", ""I would choose you"" and when Jace sung to Coop. Just too much! \n It was hard to see Coop go on without Jace but thankfully good things happen to those who wait. And Cooper put it beautifully when he said ""i can. I have I always will"". It took longer than you would\'ve hoped but time and life made \n Them realize just how much they needed one another how much they were a part of each others existence. \n The book was told from Coopers perspective so to hear from Lila that in Coopers absence Jace would curl up in bed with a stone just gave you insight to the struggle Jace was going through as well. To know his mum accepted and support his choices was necessary and evidenced when he showed her the opal, a stone as beautiful and as complex as the love these two share! \n Now excuse me whilst I go and re-read some passages this time with a tissue in hand... \n Thankyou Anyta for sharing such a beautifully written telling of age story with us!'",4.23,"Igneous.

Celaena is so badass and awesome character, I love that she loves dresses and books and candy and still is the baddest assasin ever. I'm confused with Chaol and Dorian, I shipped for the prince but now I don't know. I want to read more from Chaol's point of view! What annoyed me was that the bad guy was kind of obvious and a twist to confuse the reader didn't confuse me that much. This book wasn't perfect, but it was so near it, that I'm just going to read the next book immediately. \n Review 11/2016: I had forgotten so many things and that's why I wanted to reread this series before reading Empire of Storms.

I thought I might even end up hating it. But what do you know! I actually want to run around hugging and kissing it right now. Throne of Glass was absolutely engrossing on so many levels! \n Although the start was slightly slow for me and the romance between Dorian and Celaena seemed kind of... insta-love-ish, the mystery, intrigue, action and witty dialogues were just too amazing to make me ponder much about the tiny issues that bugged me. \n Firstly, Celaena. I would admit I was confused by her personality at the start. Was she lethal, girly, or smart? Somehow, I had the mentality that she should have an 'assassin' attitude and personality. However, I understood her better as the story progressed. Being 'Adarlan's Assassin' was simply a skill of Celaena's that she was forced to hone to perfection. I honestly doubt she would've chosen to be an assassin if she hadn't been forced into the trade. \n That was exactly what I loved about Celaena. She didn't let her 'career' define her. The fact that she's multi-faceted made her so realistic because honestly, who on Earth ever have a definite personality that can be labelled so neatly? I found myself relating to Celaena a lot - my love for reading, girly stuff, sarcasm and badass-ness - and it's really admirable, how Sarah J. Maas dared to defy the mainstream 'lethal heroines can't be girly and sassy' cliche. I understand some people might not be used to such a colorful character and become puzzled with Celaena's personality, like I did in the beginning, but in the end, I undoubtedly feel Sarah J. Maas created a wonderfully life-like protagonist here. \n As for the romance, I was sort of expecting something along the lines of a 'pick-me-and-hate-him' love triangle. I feel a little bad at the low expectations I had for Throne of Glass because actually, Chaol, the Captain of the Guard, and Dorian, the Crown Prince, were childhood friends and amazing individuals. Although I had issues with the insta-love involved in Dolaena, I utterly loved Chaolaena. Their relationship was so subtle and adorable. Moreover, the witty banter involved in both relationships are simply hilarious and shipping FEELS inducing. \n Which do I ship? Well, I like both guys but I would say I lean a little more towards Chaol. Dorian's awesome, but Chaol just seem to have this masculine aura that girls like me can't resist. ;) \n Moving on to the plot and storyline, it was wholly enjoyable and had me on the edge of my seat. The whole thing going on with Wyrdmarks was extremely fascinating to me and although I could predict the characters involved in the murder of the other Champions, it was fun just following along with everything. Another aspect of the book which I loved was Sarah J. Maas's ability to bring a fantasy world to life. The whole atmosphere in the palace was so hauntingly well done, I can still picture the corridors and rooms in my head. Little mundane things in life were also brought in, making it so much easier to relate and step into the fantasy world. \n Overall, I'm just enamored with Throne of Glass. Fantastically written with realistic and imperfect characters (Celaena did admit to using makeup to enhance her blander features before being sent to Endovier), a beautifully brutal world and impeccable pacing, Throne of Glass is one of the best YA fantasies I've read to date. It has got everything I would like in a fantasy novel - action, world-building, a kickass protagonist, fun romance, evil, intrigue and a fascinating plot. If you could see me right now, I would be jumping and yelling at you to pick up this book now!""",4.23,"""Nothing is a coincidence. Everything has a purpose.

Her grandfather never gave up on trying to find his beloved father. He went crazy, or so she and everyone thought. \n Not a bad book. I felt that the author, Rachel Carter, could have describe the events in So Close To You in greater detail. Cassandra Clare did a well job of that in City of Bones, City of Ashes, City of Glass, City of Fallen Angels, City of Lost Souls, Clockwork Prince, Clockwork Angel, and Clockwork Princess. (Or Cassandra Clare did a well job of that in every book she has wrote, for those who don\'t read Cassandra Clare and has no idea what the hell am I talking about). \n The mysterious boy... I like how the author talks about him. However, I felt that, like the events, he could have been describe in much greater detail. Then he would be unbelievably hot. The girls would never take their hands of So Close To You, like City of Bones and City of Fallen Angels and City of Lost Souls. (Not kidding, one girl I knew wouldn\'t let go of her copy of City of Lost Souls because of how obsessed she was). \n The mysterious boy... I wished he had more of an appearance in So Close To You. He appears only when he feels like it. If he appeared a little more, then he will have a greater impact on the readers. Anyway, the mysterious boy is a child time traveler. (He\'s only seventeen.) He is knowledgeable about the enemy of Lydia. He is in fact once upon a time one of them. (So this book is turning these two into starcrossed lovers. Wonderful.) \n Lydia... I can\'t tell you whether she is reckless and insane or stupid and confident. Neither of those options look good on her profile. Lydia, despite all those warnings, messes with people\'s business. She tries to change everything, but ended up making it much worse. \n Project Montauk is real. The project is a time traveling machine. The mysterious boy is part of the project. He\'s one of the few time traveler. Only children under eighteen can travel in the time traveling machine. Any older persons will be severely injured and mentally insane. It\'s a very pleasant journey for the older people right? *Shakes head* \n The plot... I love the ending, the most. Despite all the hardships and horrible events, Lydia makes the killing choice. People she loves get hurt really badly and she still made that choice. She had two choices, stopping her younger self from going into the machine or letting her younger self go into the machine and travel to the past. Guess what choice she made. \n The ending... It killed me too. I slam the book close and was tempted to throw it because of the ending. UGH!!! I hate the ending. \n SPOILERS! \n The mysterious boy is shot and assumed dead. \n Lydia lets her former self go into the machine and change time because of her love for the mysterious boy. \n Her great-grandfather was missing. When Lydia came back to the present, her grandfather was missing instead of her great-grandfather. \n Her father adopted the behavior of her grandfather after Lydia changed time. \n END SPOILER!! \n This book\'s rating is a four out of five. \n This review is also on myblog.'",3.75,"LYDIA BENTLEY has heard stories about the Montauk Project all her life: stories about the strange things that took place at the abandoned military base near her home and people who've disappeared over the years.

I have to be in the right mood to read a dystopian/science fiction/fantasy/other type of world, because I prefer contemporary and the different rules in new worlds sometimes don't mesh well with me. I watched The Story Siren's In My Mailbox last week and she mentioned Eve and how she was excited to read it - and something just clicked with me. I picked it up that night. \n Not really knowing what to expect, I ended up getting a lot more. Eve is a story of a world where a virus/plague takes out so much of the population that a new king is elected. He vows to build the country back up - and in the process sets up schools for orphans, where Eve has lived for most of her life. She finds out the real purpose of the orphan schools, and goes on the run. \n My favorite part about Eve (the book, not the girl) is that Anna Carey is not afraid to write the hard scenes. Everything does not work out perfectly for any of the characters - in fact, it's not even close to perfect - and that makes the story more real (and more thrilling) to read. It's nearly impossibly to guess what could be coming next - in fact, there are three books planned for this series, and while I know how the first book ends, I have no idea where Carey will take us in the next two, and that makes it very exciting. \n Eve grows as a character quite a bit throughout this book as well. Growing up at her orphan all girls school, she is taught many things about men that are not necessarily true, and you can see how much it skews not only her relationships, but the books she has read, her ambitions in life, etc etc. I had to remind myself many times that she reacts certain ways because she was taught to do so - Eve's thoughts and actions remain genuine to her upbringing. \n An exciting, thrilling first book of a trilogy, EVE will keep you reading as you discover the world along with Eve.""",3.69,"The year is 2032, sixteen years after a deadly virus--and the vaccine intended to protect against it--wiped out most of the earth's population. The night before eighteen-year-old Eve's graduation from her all-girls school she discovers what really happens to new graduates, and the horrifying fate that awaits her.
Fleeing the only home she's ever known, Eve sets off on a long, treacherous journey, searching for a place she can survive. Along the way she encounters Caleb, a rough, rebellious boy living in the wild. Separated from men her whole life, Eve has been taught to fear them, but Caleb slowly wins her trust...and her heart.

I figured Prom and Prejudice would be based on the original, but I wasn't entirely sure what would happen since I didn't know anything about it. \n Turns out that the story is very similar to the original, all the way down to the names used for the characters - I read a synopsis of Pride & Prejudice when I was finished and was kind of astonished at how similar they were. Though, for all I know, this is how all adaptations are done. I mean, obviously some things were changed - our plot revolves around the prom, for example. I'm not sure how some people read adaptation after adaptation if they really are exactly the same, but we all like different things I guess :) \n I enjoyed myself throughout the story. It teaches the reader about prejudice (imagine that), and has a little bit of a complex storyline (what with all of the different relationships and families, anyway). I was actually sincerely shocked at one of the twists, which I think even those familiar with the original may find surprising (though maybe not, I'm not sure). Of course, I enjoy a good romance, and there is certainly a good amount of that in this book. Each of the characters had a distinctive personality, and I did really like Lizzie (our main character). \n Prom and Prejudice would be a great gateway to the actual novel it is based on. Introducing a younger reader to this shorter version would definitely intrigue them, as I myself have now considered reading the original classic, and would imagine many other readers may feel the same way!""",3.82,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single girl of high standing at Longbourn Academy must be in want of a prom date.

I have to confess that I haven\'t read ""Pride and Prejudice"" (I know I\'ve lost all credibility), but I figured I could give this book a chance. I wasn\'t really expecting much. The cover made it sound like a typical teen drama of misunderstanding and then reconciliation; at the end all of the characters are friends and everyone\'s happy and better off. \n This book ended up being much more than that. Although I\'m sure it pales in comparison to the real thing, I felt that this novel actually had substance and personality. I liked Lizzie, the main character, and she seemed like a real person. She definitely had flaws but she was also pretty nice. The other characters were well developed too with the exception of Lizzie\'s roommate,Jane. Jane was so nice and cloyingly sweet she reminded me of Melanie from ""Gone With the Wind."" Her character was just too darn clueless. How could she think so highly of everyone after the way so many people in the school treated her good friend? \n Also, some of the dialogue is a bit misleading? At first I was confused about the time period of the story. I thought it was modern day but then some character would say something like, ""so and so were smitten with each other"" and I\'d think maybe this is the 1800\'s. No self-respecting teenager, no matter how rich, smart or well-educated says ""smitten."" Have you ever heard Nate Archibald or Blair Waldorf say ""smitten?"" \n Oh well, over all this was an enjoyable story and had enough twists and unusual characters to keep it interesting.

Sure, but it was a nice light read just the same. If you're a P&P fan, I definitely suggest adding this to your reading pile! And if you haven't read it yet, but happen to be a teen that will most likely have Pride and Prejudice as mandatory reading in your English class, you could get a jump start and read this one first; you'll get to read a totally cute story and I'm willing to bet it'll help with any essays or quizzes you'll have on it, or just your overall understanding of the book.

I thought it was a pretty good read. I read Linger months later, and liked it quite a bit more than Shiver (the world of Sam and Grace had already been built so there was more room for action). \n I read Forever and liked it five times more than Linger because it was AMAZING. \n I guess now would be the time for me to admit that for the first 25 pages of Forever I was utterly, totally confused. Forever is from four points of view, and so much happened at the end of Linger that I couldn't keep it all straight in my head. I ended up having to read a spoilery review of Linger to get the gist of it all flowing the right way in my head again (so I strongly suggest you reread or do a little research before starting this one). \n Maggie Stiefvater's writing is simply beautiful. Even those that didn't care much for Shiver commented on how wonderful her writing is, and she does not disappoint in the final installment of The Wolves of Mercy Falls. It jumps us right to where Linger left off, and from there we are right back with Grace, Isabel, Sam, and Cole. \n The middle of Forever got a little long for me, but that's my only complaint. The last third of the book flew by and had my heart pounding. Steifvater doesn't use predictable outcomes to satisfy the reader, which was my favorite part - she wrote this book in a real, true way, and it resonated with me as a reader. \n It's not often that I love the last book in a series much much more than the others, but there is no denying that Forever surpasses both Shiver and Linger in my mind.""",3.91,"then.

And then the third novel came along. I have so much to say and I'll try my best to sum it up. \n Maggie Stiefvater is a very very talented writer. She writes beautifully and uses very rich, lyrical descriptions that make me really see the emotions and actions of the book. But she doesn't close the deal on this series, and before anyone jumps on me as per the end of the book this IS the end of the series. \n So here's my problem. This book focused so much on Cole/Isabelle but I didn't care for them. There was so much focus on these two that the real love of Sam/Grace got lost in translation. \n After the whole lost love of Sam/Grace, you come up with the hundreds of questions that are left unsolved by this novel. Nothing is answered, in fact, more questions come up from this novel than anything else. For example, what is this cure? What happens to it? What happens with Grace and her parents or does she just leave them? What about school? NONE of this is described. \n There is so much time focused on the science part in the first book, and yet nothing is answered. Why are the wolves transforming in MN? Is MN the only place that has this problem? If not why are the other areas not dealing with deaths, etc? How do others handle it? \n Overall, I feel as if I wasted time and energy on a series that fell flat. As a reader I feel cheated, and am sadden that such a talented author had to leave the book as such.""",3.91,"then.

It is rich in details and features varied characters from different ages and vastly different backgrounds. The main character in this story is young Harriet, who was a baby when Robin was murdered.

Her prose is absolutely beautiful. With that being said, she needs an editor badly; someone to reel her in when she begins to wax poetically into a never-ending stream of consciousness. The reason why Tartt gets away with ridiculously long narratives because of how well written it actually is and, in another 10 years when her next novel comes out, the masses will clamour on how it is the greatest thing since the pre sliced bagel. \n The Little Friend, just like The Secret History and The Goldfinch, started out strongly usually with a death. Nine year old Robin is found hanged on a Mother's Day afternoon. The event deeply affects the Cleve Dufrenes family for many year culminating in Robin's youngest sister, Harriet, investigating and zeroing in on the Meth making and dealing Ratcliff family. Specifically on Danny Ratcliff since he was the same age as Robin and apparently did mean things to Robin. \n Now, for people expecting this to be a mystery will be sorely disappointed. SPOILER ALERT: Robin's killer is never revealed. That I could easily get over. The crux of the story was how Robin's senseless death continues to keep his family stagnant, as it did with his mother Charlotte and sister Allison, or change them fundamentally as it did with his grandmother Edie. \n The Little Friend is a Southern Gothic family drama and if Tartt had stood with the Cleve Dufrenes clan, I might have been a tad kinder with this review. However, she felt the need to give the Ratcliff family equal share and the introduction to the world's most boring drug dealing family happened. \n Reading this novel was like having a fever induced dream. There were moments of luidity like just how much the family changed, Harriet's obsession with Danny, Harriet's isolation in camp, Libby's death but the everything else bored or confused me greatly. Can anyone tell me when this book takes place? I swear I couldn't pin it down. I hated the Ratcliffs, the Odoms, and Hely! God Hely was so annoying! I was hoping he would upset a behive, get stunned, and die My Girl style but no. \n The Little Friend was about 610 pages. I believe that I deserved a better ending than the one I got. What the hell was that? I can say confidently that I am never reading another Tartt novel.

Her investigation leads her in the direction of a poor local family. Soon, Harriet becomes swept up in breathtakingly amoral choices and sets in motion events that lead to their own tragic consequences. \n The Little Friend is a long book, and it drags in the middle. The broad sweep of the novel is compelling. Tartt asks us questions: about race and class, and the impact of family history on individual outcomes; on the possibility of children committing adult and dangerous acts, and how the adults around them misinterpret those events. She creates a rich portrait of a small Mississippi town which seems somehow apart from time. Indeed, it is not clear if it's intentional, but it's hard to pin down the time that the novel is set. Little historical nuggets are dropped, but I found myself revising the time upwards again and again until the first clear historical time was pinpointed for me.

On a Mother\'s Day afternoon in the 1960\'s, nine-year old Robin was found hung from a tree near the back lot of the property. His sisters, four-year old Alison and baby Harriett in her stroller, were nearby in the back yard. The murder was never solved. No one had any clues to go on and the death of little Robin became the stuff of legend in the town. His image was even incorporated as one of the little children surrounding Jesus in a church\'s stained glass window. \n Donna Tartt\'s second novel, \'The Little Friend\', never solves the mystery of Robin\'s murder so those expecting a riveting murder yarn unfolding in a web of clues and revelations will be disappointed. What \'The Little Friend\' deals with is a paralyzed family. The parents, Charlotte and Dix, are separated. Dix took a job in Nashville, supports the family financially and usually pays an annual visit. Charlotte spends her days sedated by tranquilizers much of the time, emotionally remote and inaccessible. Alison sleeps 12-14 hours a day, depending on whether she has to be at school. Harriett is now a sassy twelve-year old, a mercurial tomboy that spends much of her time reading adventures, both fictional, as in Robert Louis Stevenson\'s \'Treasure Island\', or true-life, such as accounts of Robert Scott\'s ill-fated Antarctic expedition. With so much time on her hands, she plays with a younger boy, Hely Hull. Together they think of fanciful schemes and adventures, usually harmless. That changes after Harriett attempts to penetrate the mystery of her older brother\'s death. Her sister and her mother both avoid the subject whenever Harriett asks them about it, as do her grandmother Edie and great aunts Libby, Adelaide and Tatty. \n Hely\'s older brother, Pemberton, was a friend of Robin\'s and when Harriett asks him about what he knows he tells her about Danny Ratliff and the rest of his poor white trash clan. He says that Danny used to boast about doing a lot of horrible things (although, interestingly enough, none of them was the murder of Robin). Pemberton tells her about the rest of the clan--older demented brother Farish, who shot himself in the head and somehow survived and served time in a mental institution; Eugene, who served time in prison, became born again, now an evangelical snake handler; the youngest, a retarded boy named Curtis, the only one who has a sweet nature and means no harm to anyone. All of these details accumulate in Harriett\'s mind to convince her that Danny was the one who killed Robin. No one suspected him because he was a kid at the time. Harriett proceeds to enact a campaign of vigilante justice that spirals out of control as soon as it stops being a Harriett/Hely fantasy and transforms into destructive action. Beyond that I will not summarize. \n Harriett has the same general physical appearance as Scout in the film version of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\' although she is about six to eight years older. Scout is also much more innocent and milder in her rebellions. Like Dill, Hely is a similar little sidekick, although Hely contemplates more dangerous schemes and continually fantasizes that he\'s James Bond on his latest caper. Incidentally, Hely is not the \'little friend\' of the title. The actual little friend is not who most readers would suspect. \n The Ratliffs are slightly similar to the Ewells of \'To Kill a Mockingbird\' although they are more akin to the meth families of Elmore Leonard\'s Harlan County in the TV series \'Justified\'. Danny is also not the psycho killer that Harriett has conjured in his mind. He is a tired, wasted meth addict that just wants to get out from under the insane tyranny of his brother Farish. \n Donna Tartt obviously knows this region as it is a fictional counterpart to where she grew up. Harriett is roughly the same age as Donna, born in the sixties with most of her childhood and adolescence in the seventies when the action of this novel occurs. Almost any novel set in Mississippi must at some point be compared to the work of William Faulkner so here are my Faulkner observations: the Ratliffs resemble the Snopes although they\'re not as populous. Also, there is no Ratliff that has the steely determination to outwit and con his \'betters\' on the social scale, as Flem did in \'The Hamlet\' and its two sequels. Harriett\'s grandmother, Edie, and her sisters are all the daughters of the notable Judge Cleve, remnants of old Southern aristocracy similar to the Sartoris and Compson families. The family plantation, named \'Tribulation\', eventually fell into disrepair and the family fell on hard times. By the seventies, there is just an empty lot where Tribulation once stood. While all of the sisters still consider themselves in some way aging Southern belles, Edie in particular has a no-nonsense, cut to the chase manner. A former nurse, she never flinches at the sight of blood and can be counted on to not lose her cool in frightening situations. The following quote is characteristic of how she assesses social scale and race: \n ""A poor Negro has at least the excuse of his birth,"" Edie said. ""The poor white has nothing to blame for his station but his own character. Well, of course, that won\'t do. That would mean having to assume some responsibility for his own laziness and sorry behavior. No, he\'d much rather stomp around burning crosses and blaming the Negro for everything than go out and try to get an education or improve himself in any way."" \n Harriett is much like her grandmother in many ways. She has the same toughness although she is less able to conform to social expectations. She would rather suffer the boredom of a summer of humid afternoons reading or wandering than endure the hell of a summer church camp, which she has endured in the past. She also deals with her failure by justifying it as a worthy cause: \n ""Even if it meant that she had failed, she was glad. And if what she\'d wanted had been impossible from the start, still there was a certain lonely comfort in the fact that she\'d known it was impossible and had gone ahead and done it anyway."" \n Harriett has gotten an early start on teenage rebellion and distrust of authority. She is also emotionally detached from her addled, erratic mother, even when her mother explodes in a rage at her and then immediately apologizes, pulling Harriett to her breast in a vise-like hug: \n ""Up above, as if from a distance, her mother wept and coughed with muffled hacking sounds, like a shipwreck victim washed up on a beach. The pink fabric of the nightgown, pressed against Harriett\'s cheek, was so magnified that it didn\'t even look like cloth, but a technical cross-hatch of coarse, ropy skeins. It was interesting. Harriett shut the eye against her mother\'s breast. The pink vanished. Both eyes open: back it popped. She experimented with alternate winks, watching the optical illusions leap back and forth until a fat tear--inordinately huge--dropped onto the cloth and spread in a crimson stain."" \n Donna Tartt is very gifted at capturing perceptual moments such as this. She captures the flavor of humid, languid, boring summer days as well as the nighttime isolation of being at variance with the rest of the sleeping world as Harriett often gets up late at night to wander the house while her mother and sister lie oblivious in their slumbers. \n Tartt takes her time in letting the story unfold, alternating points of view between Harriett, her sister, her grandmother, Hely and the Ratliffs, often in passages that wear out their welcome with a bit too much extraneous detail. Despite the leisurely pace, I feel that the ending is a bit rushed and ends on a note of triviality, neutering the dramatic impact of the climax. Although she has already written over 600 pages, I felt like there needed to be a few more loose ends tied up, not necessarily as far as the plot, but with the primary protagonist--Harriett. Instead, the novel ends with a scene in which she is not even present. \n However, those shortcomings do not negate the power of Tartt\'s primary accomplishment which is the depiction of the unreliability of memory. Harriett\'s realization is that she can never prove or disprove an event that occurred before she was cognizant; neither can she ever live with complete certainty of the consequences of her own actions. Although Faulkner famously stated, ""The past is never dead. It\'s not even past,"" I think Donna Tartt could add, at least on the basis of \'The Little Friend\', nor is it ever any more completely knowable than the present.'",3.44,"Bestselling author Donna Tartt returns with a grandly ambitious and utterly riveting novel of childhood, innocence and evil.

He must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. 
This is the Code of the Private Eye as defined by Raymond Chandler in his 1944 essay 'The Simple Act of Murder.' Such a man was Philip Marlowe, private eye, an educated, heroic, streetwise, rugged individualist and the hero of Chandler's first novel, The Big Sleep. This work established Chandler as the master of the 'hard-boiled' detective novel, and his articulate and literary style of writing won him a large audience, which ranged from the man in the street to the most sophisticated intellectual.
Marlowe subsequently appeared in a series of extremely popular novels, among them The Lady in the Lake, The Long Goodbye, and Farewell, My Lovely."" ~ Elizabeth Diefendorf, editor, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century, p. 112.

She\'s more focused on her budding romance with the school outcast, Ollie, until a second murder strikes fear into everyone in town. Maybe Makani lying so she can spend more time with Ollie is putting her in even greater jeopardy, since she might be next on the killer\'s list. She hasn\'t told anyone the reason she moved from Hawaii to Nebraska, and the killer seems focused on offing students who stand out in some way. \n I know 3 stars seems like a low rating - I think I might have had my expectations too high for this book. At the Boston Teen Author Festival a couple of weeks ago, one of the authors was talking about subverting tropes and how this novel didn\'t, it was just a perfectly executed thriller. So I knew going in that there wasn\'t going to be a twist at the end, that it was a straight teen slasher novel. There are definitely some wonderfully creepy moments, which scarily resemble one of my worst nightmares, wherein the victims discover common objects in their homes moved around. It\'s definitely a great thriller, and the pace kept me turning pages. \n In relation to the trope conversation above, I think there are a lot of young readers who have never read a straight thriller, and so for them this is new, but for me this is simply a better-written version of the R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike novels I devoured as a teen. Honestly I kept waiting for a twist, especially after they figured out the identity of the killer about 60% of the way through the book. The hot pink of the cover text and book design led me to believe the killer had to be Ollie, who has pink dyed hair . For some reason, the movie ""Scream"" kept coming into my head, and I figured there would be two killers. I also expected, from the title, that the grand finale would happen inside Makani\'s house. It happened in a haunted corn maze, which was fantastic, but again I just expected something different . I also expected, after Makani reveals the reason she left Hawaii, for that to somehow come into play. The killer\'s reasoning felt a little weak and I wanted it all to be more connected somehow, more so than it was. \n So, I am giving this three stars because it was enjoyable to read and well-written, but didn\'t do anything new for the genre.'",3.44,"Love hurts...

Zoe Maisey is a seventeen-year-old musical prodigy with a genius IQ. Three years ago, she was involved in a tragic incident that left three classmates dead. She served her time, and now her mother, Maria, is resolved to keep that devastating fact tucked far away from their new beginning, hiding the past even from her new husband and demanding Zoe do the same.
Tonight Zoe is giving a recital that Maria has been planning for months. It needs to be the performance of her life. But instead, by the end of the evening, Maria is dead.
In the aftermath, everyone--police, family, Zoe's former solicitor, and Zoe herself--tries to piece together what happened. But as Zoe knows all too well, the truth is rarely straightforward, and the closer we are to someone, the less we may see.

Here are my thoughts: \n ^^ This is the story of a couple, Anne and Marco Conti, who plan to go next door for a party around their neighbour's house, but after the childminder lets them down last minute, they convince themselves not to cancel but to go anyway, with the idea that it will be all right to leave their baby at home and check on her every half hour. After all, they have a baby monitor with them, too. What could possibly go wrong? It's only next door. \n ^^ When the baby goes missing we delve further into each characters lives to discover what really went on. But it's just not that simple, as with most stories like this, there are often unreliable witnesses and hidden story depths that make it less easy for the reader to work out the truth straight away. This is what happens in this book , and even though I had my suspicions instantly about who done it, the why and the how was not revealed until the very end. \n ^^ The Couple Next Door is told in different point of views and with a limited omniscient point of view where the author Shari Lapena limits the readers to being in one character's head at a time. We hear their thoughts, see their actions, we understand what they are not saying to the other characters and know if they are lying to themselves. Writing this way is very clever and gaining popularity again. \n ^^ This story throws out all sorts of questions. What would you have done? Who really is in the wrong here? Is being weak a crime? It also shows you how life can change dramatically in a blink of an eye from one single bad decision. It's the sort of story most people say 'chances of that happening in real life are extremely rare', but you only have to look at the news, on your computer, phone or newspapers to see the truth... People are people and some are capable of doing some very strange things. \n Overall: \n I've been lucky and read two books within one week that were equally enthralling, suspenseful and fast paced, so much so I didn't want to put either books down until finished. With this one, Shari Lapena 's The Couple Nextdoor, I find it slightly beats the other as the story still lingered in the back of my mind long after I'd finished reading; the clever plot twists, the the red herrings, and other tension strengthening distractions, and the marvellous, most satisfying way it all came together at the end, but with more shocks to boot. I can happily recommend this as a well crafted story that truly made me think about what people really are capable of when pushed to their absolute limit. And I mean this from both the antagonist and the protagonist's point of view.""",3.74,"You never know what's happening on the other side of the wall.

I could have even pretended to believe the ending, that all could be settled that well and fast (before the final plot twist, all so unnecessary and so far fetched). I could maybe have also pretended that all characters weren't either stereotypes wrapped in cliches or just plain cardboards. \n However...it is not well written. It's juvenile at best. It reads like a high-schooler trying to reach the word count by repeating the same sentence here and there over and over, hoping the teacher won't notice. That if they pretend it's just to remind the reader of some key point (that I could have come to myself, thank you very much AND that has been said at least 3 or 4 times before!) it wouldn't sound like just plain repetition, on top of telling not showing. \n All in all I wouldn't recommend this novel unless you want to know the mystery because it's been talked.

It sounded good and one of my fave booktubers recommended it. \n But I was really let down by this novel. \n Anne and Marco Conti just had their first baby. Anne suffers from postpartum depression. Marco wonders where his wife has gone. The couple next door offer a night to get away from their problems. But the babysitter cancels and Anne and Marco just decide to leave their baby at home unattended. And by the time they get home, the baby is missing. \n Of course, this dredges up all of the horrible secrets that the couple have been keeping from each other. It brings in the in-laws who hate Marco and have spoiled Anne. And drama ensues. \n Why didn't I like this novel? One of the major things that bothered me within the first hundred pages was the writing style. The writing is told entirely in the third person and it is just very stilted. There was no emotion. \n And I wanted to make a drinking game for every time the author mentions that the detective will figure out the truth behind it all (really? that seemed necessary to repeat a billion times?). \n The plot line is very slow. In fact, at least half of the novel is just the parents agonizing over what they've kept from each other. Very little actually happens. \n And I didn't find the resolution of this novel to be satisfying-at all. ****SPOILERS First off, how did Marco get hit in the head by the kidnapper if the kidnapper is the father-in-law? Since the father-in-law was at the house and nowhere near the rendezvous point? And the accomplice was already dead? And what was that business about the next door neighbors being in some sort of illegal sex-tape thing? And then that the neighbor was sleeping with the father-in-law? And about Anne's blackouts and she goes nuts on the neighbor? SPOILERS**** I felt like so many things were just not wrapped up properly.

Eva is walking by the river one afternoon when a body floats to the surface of the icy water. She tells her daughter to wait patiently while she calls the police, but when she reaches the phone box, Eva dials another number altogether. The dead man, Egil, has been missing for months, and it doesn't take long for Inspector Sejer and his team to establish that he was the victim of a very violent killer, but the trail has gone cold. It's as puzzling as another unsolved case on Sejer's desk: the murder of a prostitute who was found dead just before Egil went missing.
While Sejer is trying to piece together the fragments of a seemingly impossible case, Eva gets a phone call late one night. A stranger speaks, then swiftly hangs up. Eva looks out into the darkness and listens. All is quiet. Gripping and thought-provoking, this is Karin Fossum's first novel featuring the iconic Inspector Sejer.

(Alex had been wanted by the FBI due to fabricated charges and double-agent shenanigans. Hunter was shot in the kerfuffle, and is still recuperating.) They met when Alex was working at a busy, urban hospital emergency room together. Hunter is a Physician's Assistant, though he hasn't worked in six months due to recovery from his injury. Alex had his graduate school dreams derailed by the FBI manhunt and has since found a new purpose: joining the FBI to help root out bad agents, if he gets accepted. \n In the meantime, they accept a trip to the isolated Caribbean isle of Saba to spend time with old friends of Alex's mothers. Reunited with a childhood friend, Orfeo, Alex's budding Feeb senses begin to tingle--particularly when Orfeo's partner Max and his sister Talisha seem to get freaked out by Alex's desire to join the FBI. Hunter can't help noticing how agitated they become, too, so it's not only Alex getting worried about his friend's welfare. This is not an exaggeration; the island's first murder in a decade occurs a few days later, and the subject was a PI staying at Orfeo's hotel. Despite their worries, Alex and Hunter make a lot of headway into their own sexytimes--and Hunter considers making some serious declarations...of the marital type. If he can muster the nerve, that is. \n As a hurricane bears down on Saba the whole mystery becomes infinitely more deadly. And not just because of the weather. Max and Talisha have Really Bad Guys on their tail who are probably only the tip of the gargantuan iceberg of their problems. Expect a lot of hiding, scrabbling for incriminating details, and sexytimes. Oh, also, a hurricane, two desperate chases, dangerous criminals, and collaboration with known felons to hopefully make it out alive. It's an intriguing romantic suspense, and I'm sure we'll see more of Hunter and Alex in another book, likely set in Quantico, VA!""",4.12,"When Hunter and Alex (formally Shawn) are given the vacation of a lifetime, it's a chance for them to pay attention to romance and get out of the path of danger. The tiny Caribbean island of Saba is gorgeous, the first to have marriage equality, and the Sabans are the nicest people on earth.
There's lots of rum poolside for relaxing and a room with a mirror on the ceiling for passion. Hot karaoke nights, cold beer, and new friends.
Their new friends Orfeo and Max, and Max's sister Talisha, share a troubling secret. Alex and Hunter want to help. As a hurricane bears down on them, a dead body surfaces, and a purple backpack loaded with stolen jewels leads a pair of dangerous men to the island.
Alex would rather poke his own eyes out with a pointy stick than call on his old enemy Nick Truman for help; he'd also do anything to keep Hunter out of danger. But even his nemesis can't reach them now.

This review may have some LIMITED spoilers, only in the discussion of one character\'s inexplicably odd/incriminating behavior. \n Two foundling twin girls have an imaginary triplet upon whom they blame all their troubles. They have a rather charmed life, adopted by a wealthy bachelor and cared for by a dedicated cook/nanny. As teens, Alexa (Lexi) and Ava have given a whole new dimension to ""Alicia."" \n Ava likes to have an alternate identity, ""Alicia"", so she can date guys who are socially ""unsuitable"" but fun for a few dates. She leaves them wanting, but occasionally has a time conflict with her dates, so she enlists Lexi to help cover. As they are so close in appearance, the guys are none the wiser. Lexi is the bookish girl, wholly different from the sexier Ava. She does enjoy being Alicia, because this persona is confident and risky. Lexi would never date a rocker, but Alicia? She relishes Eli\'s soulfulness. \n Thing is, something has gone horribly wrong. Casey was a grabby-date-rapey-y guy, who Lexi barely escaped from; the next night he was killed. The police are looking for Alicia in connection. But, Alicia doesn\'t exist. Does she? A speeding ticket for a vehicle Alicia shows up at their home. \n Then another boy ""Alicia"" dated ends up dead. Now Lexi is determined to figure out who is setting her up, even if it\'s...Ava. \n I liked this, but I had some issues with the absolutely dumb things that Lexi does: like posing as Alicia to talk to the police, without telling anyone, just to ""find out"" what the cops knew. That\'s like Dumb X 1000. Or, when she\'s been ARRESTED and out on recognizance then learns there\'s a new target, she poses, again, as Alicia to ""warn him"". As if this won\'t be a problem. \n The book is interesting, and I liked all the twists. I didn\'t guess the true killer until the bigger reveal, so, excellent job with all the red herrings. #Props \n My biggest issue was with Lexi\'s almost willful ignorance of the danger in which she operated--she\'s a suspect in not one, but TWO murders. Even Ava, who is as SoCal superficial as they come, had the good sense to KEEP HER TRAP SHUT under questioning, leading me to wonder why Ava didn\'t apply for Stanford, instead of the ""bookish"" Lexi. Lexi seemed criminally naive, in that sense. I wonder if teens will see this my way. My own teen son branded Lexi TSTL, and I was *nearly* inclined to agree.'",3.8,"Identical twins. Identical DNA. Identical suspects. It's Pretty Little Liarsmeets Revengein this edge-of-your-seat thriller with a shocking twist.
When they were little, Lexi and her identical twin, Ava, made up a third sister, Alicia. If something broke? Alicia did it. Cookies got eaten? Alicia's guilty. Alicia was always to blame for everything. The game is all grown up now that the girls are seniors. They use Alicia as their cover to go out with boys who are hot but not exactly dating material. Boys they'd never, ever be with in real life.
Now one of the guys Alicia went out with has turned up dead, and Lexi wants to stop the game for good. As coincidences start piling up, Ava insists that if they follow the rules for being Alicia, everything will be fine.

She's almost 18 and never gone to school. She is homeschooled by her mother, Shaylene, and spends 6 of 7 days a week in their apartment in Scottsdale, AZ. Every Friday they leave the apartment together, so Shelby can hit balls at the local batting cage, then they have ice cream for dinner and Shelby goes to the library, unescorted, for a few hours while her mother works. This library time is the only time Shelby is ever left alone outside their apartment. \n She has never has a friend, and has no siblings. Her father is dead, and he was horrible, or so she has been told. Then, one Friday, while waiting to get picked up outside the library, Shelby is struck by a car. In her pain she meets, well, a coyote, who advises her that she will learn two lies and one truth about her life. \n For a moment I wondered if Shelby had hit the peyote, but she hadn't. She did have a broken ankle, however, and in the aftermath of her care finds herself and her mother on the road. Escaping, her mother tells her, from her (dead) father. Because if he finds them, they're as good as dead. Yep. Guess Shelby's dad isn't so dead after all. \n Or, is he? How can Shelby trust her mom--as she watches her befriend unsuspecting men with the objective of stealing their vehicles. And, the coyote continues to return. \n When Shelby sleeps she falls into the Dreaming, a place of myth and mystery where she is the Maiden and must rescue the crying Child from a malevolent force in order to restore the rain and keep the Dreaming alive. In this mythical place Shelby is aided by the trickster Coyote, as well as the stalwart Elk and strong Eagle. It is here she is told she has 8 days to save the Child or the Dreaming--and Shelby's whole universe--will be destroyed. \n This is a strongly metaphysical book, with real and mythical touch points. In her waking life, Shelby learns that there are very big portions of her life that are lies, and the truth that is revealed is just as devastating. There are car chases, and police actions and people who try to help and end up only causing more harm. \n I adored the elements of First Nations mysticism and mythology that were interwoven. This book sang with cultural tenets, and a realistic depiction of a displaced teen. Shelby, herself, is at a major disadvantage as her own advocate--not because she is young (she's almost an adult) but because people assume she is disabled. She has some difficulties, but that doesn't diminish her capability. Throughout Shelby is self-possessed and as independent as she is ever allowed to be. \n I am not ashamed to admit there were twists I didn't see coming. I did, however, predict the bulk of the ending--as the foreshadowing was excellent. The ticking time bomb of Shelby's world is a strong motivator, but she can't often access the tools, or skills, she needs to complete her quest in the Dreaming, and must return to reality to marshal resources. In the end, the heartache that is Shelby's life is greatly resolved, on her terms for a change. No more isolation. Actual friendships and autonomy, and a family she never expected. \n I received and ARC of this book via NetGalley.""",3.42,"In four hours, Shelby Jane Cooper will be struck by a car.

It takes place in the early 1970s, in Mississippi's Ford County, and revolves around the brutal murder and rape of a woman in the presence of her two young children. The suspect, pretty much assumed guilty before the trial even starts, is one Danny Padgitt, a young man who lives with his large family on the Padgitt Island just outside the town of Clanton. Danny's trial moves forward, he's found guilty, and sentenced to two terms in prison, each of them ten years in length. \n All of this is chronicled by the county's newspaper managed by new owner and editor Willy Traynor. Willy is a young fellow who has recently arrived in Clanton from Memphis, eager to exercise his journalism skills. Danny's trial and conviction is just the medicine Willy needs to increase circulation and make some money as well. \n Grisham shifts gears in the second half by showing the effect of school desegregation in the American south along with Willy's friendship with a elderly black woman named Callie. She was a juror on Danny Padgitt's trial but more remarkable is her having seven adult children, six of whom are teachers with PhDs. \n In the late 1970s, in a surprising move, Danny comes up for parole. It turns out that his ten year sentences were to run concurrently instead of sequentially, a fact that was not at all well known by Clanton residents. Danny is granted parole and that's when the trouble starts up again. Someone is murdered, a not unusual event in Ford County, but when a second murder occurs shortly after, the police take greater notice.

It's an amazing debut novel - the characters are well fledged, the plot is engaging and the ending leaves you wishing you wanting more more mysteries by Patricia Gibney. I found this book by chance my Goodreads and I am very glad I did. \n The protagonist, Detective Inspector Lottie Parker, is one of those characters you can easily relate to. She's a single working mother dealing with three teenagers, which is not easy and apart from her domestic life, she has to juggle her career as a Detective Inspector. Rather than providing a perfect super-mom, we experience DI Parker's struggles with keeping up with her career and her family, her deeply rooted grief over the loss of her husband and her insecurity and doubts of her capability of taking care of her children. \n Overall Lottie Parker is a very interesting protagonist and I am looking forward to read more mystery novels portrayed from her eyes. I also did enjoy the other supporting characters in the book, especially Boyd, who will definitely be a fan favourite for being the one who hooks up with Lottie. I have to admit, there is a certain level of charm with Kirby's personality as well. I also did warm up to the grumpy boss and her kids. The author did manage to create a well-rounded team and family, which is very reminiscent of some of the most successful TV mystery series. \n The plot shifts between two timelines; the past, in the 70's, and the present. I did enjoy the fact that the author did manage to tie off a lot of loose ends and mysteries that rose from the 70's plot-line and the mysteries that arose from the murders in the present. It is possible that it is the reason why the book is relatively long, but the short chapters did really help the readers in breezing through this book. Who am I kidding, I was so curious to uncover the secrets that I would have probably breezed through this book in any way! But it definitely did help with the flow of this book, since it's much easier to stop at the end of a chapter and restart with a fresh chapter later on. \n This book does cover some possibly controversial and disturbing matters, such as child abuse and exploitation, which does feel heavy at times. \n In any way, I really did enjoy this book and would give it a solid five stars. I have already ordered the second book, The Stolen Girls, and look forward to receiving it.""",4.12,"The hole they dug was not deep. A white flour bag encased the little body.

Detective Lottie Parker is a bit of a wild card, often breaking the rules slightly to get the outcome she wants, and her partner Mark Boyd who I really warmed to as well! They're both flawed in their own ways - neither of them are perfect - but this only makes them more likable, in my opinion! Lottie is certainly not the perfect mother but her heart is in the right place and she has her own demons to struggle with. The personal lives of the officers added an extra element to the story, on top of the already gripping investigative storyline. \n The theme of corruption in 1970's Ireland, particularly in the Catholic Church, is a well-known one and I found it really interesting (if not quite uncomfortable) to read about. It felt well-researched and full of interesting details. \n The Missing Ones moves along quickly, with no time for me to get bored or disinterested. There's elements of humour, very dark parts and others which are entertaining. The case gets very personal for Lottie and some parts felt a little unbelievable, but I feel that readers always suspend their disbelief with novels like this, and I truly enjoyed every page- a fantastic new series which I'll definitely be reading more of! \n [Rating: 4.5/5] \n Many thanks to Bookouture and Netgalley for a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review.""",4.12,"The hole they dug was not deep.

The writing is taut and effective, and I haven\'t had this much fun being scared in a long time!! ""Bird Box"" was super scary, but there was a certain type of energy that ran through ""The Deep"" that was different, and electric. \n My favorite type of horror books are those of a psychological nature, and this book delivered in droves. People slowly changed and tweaked until they were grotesque caricatures of who they once were. I loved the back story of several of the characters, the journal entries from one who had definitely lost his mind, as those expositions bring life and depth to the people represented on the page. \n I never knew what was going to happen in ""The Deep,"" I just knew it wasn\'t going to be good. Toward the last quarter, I found the action to be a bit over the top, and would have found the story scarier if Cutter had reined it in a bit. The very end I felt meh about, and kind of rewrote in my brain to better serve my purposes. I hate to poopoo a book I so thoroughly enjoyed, but I did consider the end a bit weak.

From New York Timesbestselling author Kate White comes a riveting psychological suspense in which a media star must battle a malevolent enemy who may be disturbingly close to her.
After losing her on-air job two years ago, television host Robin Trainer has fought her way back and now she's hotter than ever. With her new show climbing in the ratings and her first book a bestseller, she's being dubbed a media double threat.
But suddenly, things begin to go wrong. Small incidents at first: a nasty note left in her purse; her photo shredded. But the obnoxious quickly becomes threatening when the foundation the makeup artist uses burns Robin's face. It wasn't an accident--someone had deliberately doctored with the product.
An adversary with a dark agenda wants to hurt Robin, and the clues point to someone she works with every day.

From New York Timesbestselling author Kate White comes a riveting psychological suspense in which a media star must battle a malevolent enemy who may be disturbingly close to her.
After losing her on-air job two years ago, television host Robin Trainer has fought her way back and now she's hotter than ever. With her new show climbing in the ratings and her first book a bestseller, she's being dubbed a media double threat.
But suddenly, things begin to go wrong. Small incidents at first: a nasty note left in her purse; her photo shredded. But the obnoxious quickly becomes threatening when the foundation the makeup artist uses burns Robin's face. It wasn't an accident--someone had deliberately doctored with the product.

I haven\'t read anything else because I felt like, unless I could find it at the library and I had nothing else in my pile or I found a great deal, I\'d let them go. But then this was available on tour and the premise seemed really interesting and I thought, I haven\'t had a good thriller lately, I\'m going to give it a try. \n And.... I was disappointed. I had a hard time getting into it because I didn\'t like the main character, Robin so much. Secondly, this read a lot like Nora Roberts Private Scandals, which I read years ago and totally loved. Though that one obviously has a romance element to it and this one doesn\'t really, there were a lot of similarities for me. \n When you read the book it does feel like an episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, so in that regard I enjoyed it. But the writing felt a little flat for me and I was able to figure out who the culprit was by mid book and that always ruins the second half for me. When I read a thriller, I want to be on the edge of me seat and have the gasp with ""WHAT?!"" when the bad guy is revealed. I never want to see it coming and I want to have the wind taken out of me. You\'ll get none of that with this book. \n Overall I felt like this novel could have gone a lot further and it just didn\'t. I always set out thinking I\'m going to be a big fan and I want to be. I don\'t know why, but I want to be. And then... I don\'t know. Maybe if I hadn\'t read the Nora Roberts book, or a few others similar to it, I wouldn\'t feel so blah about this one. It\'s like re-reading the same story with slightly different details and it\'s just hard for me to say- go buy this book. \n BUT- if you haven\'t read Kate White yet, this might be a good one to start with and then read The Sixes and then read Hush because it\'ll feel like she\'s getting better and better with her writing. All would make entertaining vacation reads for sure, especially if you are looking to step out of your regular genre.'",3.13,"A Los Angeles Times""Best of Summer"" Read

When I first began reading these novels, I did so in the hope that Harry would find some happiness, somewhere, with someone special. Alas, that has not happened as of The Burning Room, number 1 in the series. Harry is an admirable protagonist, moral, compassionate, and willing to take the hard line when it's called for. He deserves better than he's gotten so far. \n The Burning Room focuses upon two cold cases, one ten years old involving the shooting of a musician who has only now died of his wounds. The second involves Harry's new partner, Lucy Soto, who is young but has already begun to make her mark in the police force. When Lucy was a child, she was present when her day care center was torched, resulting in the death of several of her teachers and classmates. In fact, Lucy became a cop because of her desire to find out who committed that arson. \n Sometimes the Bosch novels are action-laden, and sometimes they're more internal. The Burning Room is one of the latter. As a result, it's more of a police procedural than anything else, so don't look for suspense and drama here. As always, politics in the department and in LA play a major role. But watching Harry as he mentors Lucy, in whom he sees himself as a young detective, and as he ponders the whole of his career, is rewarding in itself. This novel ends in a mild sort of cliff hanger, though if you look at chronology of the series, it's pretty clear what happens next. \n On to the next installment, The Crossing.""",4.05,"Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

So far back, that I can't even remember all the homicide cases that he has solved. Harry Bosch is the epitome of a tough as nails homicide detective, one that almost always gets his man. I thought I had read them all, but I think I missed The Black Box, and I really need to get on that! \n As a rule, I usually like my homicide detectives to be women, I guess because I can relate to them better. Women in jeopardy, and all that. From the minute I started reading these books, it didn't matter one bit that the main character was a man. Harry is smart, and he doesn't take anything from anyone. He knows he is a good cop, and if he has to skirt the edges of impropriety, he will, if it gets the job done. He's been through several partners-some have even died-and he has been through the wringer with all the politics of the LAPD. \n This time around, he has one year left until retirement. He has been assigned a new partner, one that is new to the job. It's up to Bosch to mentor her, and teach her the job before he leaves. Lucy was a hotshot(literally) policewoman, who was involved in a shooting, one that awarded her the Medal of Valor from the police department. This jump started her career to detective. She chooses to work in the cold case department. She has her own reasons to pick that department, due to a sad past involving a cold case that she was involved in as a child. \n So not only do they investigate the case from her childhood, but they also investigate the case of a mariachi band member that was shot in broad daylight ten years before. It took the victim ten years, but now that he has died, it's a homicide. \n It's always fascinating to see everything Bosch goes through to solve a case. Working on two cases at the same time is not an obstacle for him. Lucy, holds her own beautifully as well. As usual, these cases get them involved in politics, both police and governmental. \n I did have one problem with this book. At times, it almost read as a police procedural manual, which is fine if you want to know all those things. I think a lot of it could have been left out, and it would have made for a much more enjoyable read. It took me about a fourth of the way in before I really got involved in the story, and I think it was due to this. This was unusual for me, and a Harry Bosch book. That being said, it ended up being a good installment of these books, and very much worth the read for all mystery fans out there. I will definitely be getting the next book when it comes out!(PureTextuality.com)""",4.05,"Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

This crime novel features Detective Harry Bosch, one of the authors long standing protagonists. It kept my interest ok but was not a nail biter. It was missing a lot of the intensity of previous Bosch novels. Maybe because Bosch himself is nearing retirement, but the plot line in this one was not something that will stick with a reader long after one closes the book. \n One gripe I had was with some of the Spanish used in the novel not being correct. An example is the name of a restaurant in L.A. which he calls Poquito Pedro\'s. He states it means ""Little Pedro\'s."" The word ""poquito"" is usually used to describe a small amount of something, not used with a persons name. Another time he states the city of Adelanto means ""going forward"" but the word for that is actually ""adelante"" with an ""e"" at the end. I realize these are nit-picking gripes but one would think that in LA it would be easy to get an accurate translation. I\'m a bilingual LA native and am sure there are a few of us around with journalism backgrounds. I did chuckle a little when he used my last name as the surname of one of his characters. It isn\'t a commonly used surname in any novels I\'ve ever read, that was a surprise, but at least he spelled it correctly, lol :) \n One thing I did enjoy was the historical incidents he referred to about the City of Angels that were accurate.'",4.05,"Detective Harry Bosch tackles a cold case unlike any he's ever worked, in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly.In the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit, not many murder victims die almost a decade after the crime.

Something strange is happening up the mountain and Viktor, Navy SEAL, is going to find out exactly what it is and why his nephew ended up in a coma in hospital. His family is at risk and he will do everything and anything to protect them. \n It is a romance, a story of second and third chances. Viktor and Aiden (who is now working in law enforcement) knew each other in high school, where Aiden had long term expectations. Years later when they reconnect, he still loves Viktor. But Viktor is a man haunted by his belief that as a SEAL he can't offer anything to anyone. He runs. It takes the threat to his family to bring Viktor and Aiden together again as they put their lives at risk to solve the mystery. \n This is a story with lots of drama and action- murder, villains and true hero moments- but also soul searching as Aiden and Viktor fight their attraction to each other. The sex is super hot and the ending fabulous- i just love big moments that make people face the truth! \n I enjoyed the blend of mystery and romance and the pacing of the book. Sure, at moments Viktor annoyed the hell out of me but the happy ending for these heroes was definitely worth it. \n I am now very much looking forward to the second book, Last Marine Standing, due to be released in June, which gives us Sam's story. \n A copy of this book was received from the author with no expectations of a review. \n For m/m romance reviews and more check out Because Two Men Are Better Than One!""",3.77,"When SEAL, Viktor Zavodny, left small town America for the Navy he made sure he never had a reason to return for anything other than visiting family.

It had two great MC's and a plot that kept me glued to my kindle app. And while I loved both Viktor and Aiden, I understand why people didn't like him as much, or at all. He wasn't the easiest guy in the world to like. \n There was sexual tension in this book and it was so hot. Possibly the hottest thing in this book, which wasn't a bad thing actually. Also, I have come to the conclusion that I really like when MC's separate for silly reasons and come back together in some way. Most of the time I'm able to understand the reasons, like in this. I think it could be the reason I was able to like Viktor as much as I did. \n I thought the MC's were so perfect for each other, even if Viktor didn't want to believe it and Aiden tried to deny it because he was angry (totally understandable, btw). And I liked not knowing how they would get back together, or get together I should probably say since they were never a proper couple. Anyway, I thought the chemistry was definitely there and I enjoyed reading it. \n I also think people who like a mystery will enjoy this. There is enough of that here to satisfy fans of mystery. Honestly, I really enjoyed that part of it too. It just kept me hooked and I didn't want this book to finish when it did.

For ten years Will has been missing, committed to an insane asylum by his own father. Kiera is sympathetic to her mentor's plight, especially when rumors swirl about a local girl gone missing.

Christmas shoppers stop to hear a Salvation Army concert on a crowded Oslo street. A gunshot cuts through the music and the bitter cold: one of the singers falls dead, shot in the head at point-blank range.

The presentation of the London theater scene during the between wars era is appealing. And the collective and personnal feelings of loss and confusion following the events of the Great War were compellingly told. \n I\'m not sure what, other than publicity value, led the author to use Josephine Tey as the name of the central character, rather than her real-life name Elizabeth Mackintosh. I think the story would have had even more pizzazz if instead of using made-up characters and pseudonyms, the author had used the real names and characters of persons associated with the actual production of ""Richard of Bordeaux"", as in portraying John Gielgud in the role which made him famous, as Richard of Bordeaux.

It mixes in the elements you will see from your typical slasher movie, but also adds a paranormal, demonic possession storyline ala Exorcist. If I was being nitpicky, I'd say it was less Scream like though, as Scream was a movie that tossed the slasher conventions on their head, and created clever twists using those tropes. This book does play it more standard, and is therefore more generic than clever in the end. Despite this however, I did enjoy this. \n The plot line for 'The Harrowing' follows five teenagers, all from different social groups, who have decided to stay within the confines of their university during a holiday period instead of going home. While alone on campus, they make the clever horror movie decision to play with a ouija board, and chaos ensues.... \n What I most appreciated about this book was that it actually put some though into the demonic possession angle. While the entity is of course evil, it's not simply just the devil, or a dead person with 'unfinished business'. The twists and turns kept me intrigued to the finale, and while ultimately the whole thing is a little predictable, I can at least say I was entertained throughout. \n The characters here are pretty generic, each one belonging to your typical horror movie archetypes. We have the geek, the jock, the slut, the goth, and the supposed 'cool dude'. While the characters themselves don't stand out too much, and there's not too much to get attached to in anyway. I can say overall that I at least liked them all, there weren't any annoying characters in the group to bring the novel down and that probably ended up relating to my enjoyment of the story. \n Overall though, this is a perfectly fun read. You won't really remember too much after you have read it, and it's certainly not going to go down as one of the best of the genre, but it keeps you entertained, and is a quick easy read, so that gets an easy 3 stars from me.""",3.68,"Baird College's Mendenhall echoes with the footsteps of the last home-bound students heading off for Thanksgiving break, and Robin Stone swears she can feel the creepy, hundred-year-old residence hall breathe a sigh of relief for its long-awaited solitude.

As a massive storm dumps rain on the isolated campus, four other lonely students reveal themselves: Patrick, a handsome jock; Lisa, a manipulative tease; Cain, a brooding musician; and finally Martin, a scholarly eccentric. Each has forsaken a long weekend at home for their own secret reasons.
The five unlikely companions establish a tentative rapport, but they soon become aware of a sixth presence disturbing the ominous silence that pervades the building.
