       "0  Chetan Bhagat sir. Seriously this is your best work. The way you represented an unlove story & a murder mystery is worth reading. The characters, dialogues, locations & everything about the book is amazing. And yes I can say now that 'The girl is room number 105' is my favourite book I've read so far. The story shows real faces of people which is hidden behind several layers. Finally, I enjoyed a lot & would feel great to recommend the same to other readers. And hope more interesting books fr...  \n",

The characters, dialogues, locations & everything about the book is amazing. And yes I can say now that 'The girl is room number 105' is my favourite book I've read so far. The story shows real faces of people which is hidden behind several layers. Finally, I enjoyed a lot & would feel great to recommend the same to other readers. And hope more interesting books fr...  \n",

       "1    A beautifully knitted plot. Thoroughly enjoyable. This is Chetan Bhagat's undeniable quality. You won't be bored. But to me his work is like a bollywood movie where everything will be fine at the end. Though life does not work like that. His work lacks this. But '2 States' & \"Revolution 20/20' are different.               \n",
       "2    This is still my favorite book, and the first book i read. Was really well written and good story. Though there are some fiction beyond human things, it is worth the read. Will make you understand life.. Lots of small messages in this book, if you understand the depth of the story. A must read.                             \n",

       "0     Chetan Bhagat sir. Seriously this is your best work. The way you represented an unlove story & a murder mystery is worth reading. The characters, dialogues, locations & everything about the book is amazing. And yes I can say now that 'The girl is room number 105' is my favourite book I've read so far. The story shows real faces of people which is hidden behind several layers. Finally, I enjoyed a lot & would feel great to recommend the same to other readers. And hope more interesting books fr...   \n",
