Review to follow.',3.97,"Chase Walker used to be a good kid--charming, athletic, and with a bright future ahead, but that was before travesty struck his life, sinking him into deep despair.

Fed up with watching her son destroy his life, Chase's mom relocates him to live in a small ranching community with his ex-military grandfather. Chase is far from happy about the situation until he meets, Nikki, the cute cheerleader who won't give football players like him the time of day.
Chase enjoys a good challenge though and sets out to claim Nikki for his own. He soon discovers she's more than a pretty face--she's a balm to his troubled spirit also.

I love these types of love stories. I loved Chase and I loved Nikki. \n Chase being a boy who was troubled and just needed a chance and Nikki being the girl who loved and gave the broken boy love.

The last book to affect me like this was Slammed by Colleen Hoover. Lacey Weatherford did such an amazing job with the story and her characters. So many lessons to be learned, the struggles, learning to deal with the past to make a better future. Chase, there is definately more to him that meets the eye but he comes off as your typical football player. Nikki has been burned in the past and doesn't trust guys, especially football players. This book had me BAWLING! It was a good cry, sob, fountain of tears and sooooo very worth it.

She lives in a time when the children of the United States contract a horrible disease that most likely kills them. Most of her class died because of this disease, but she's been lucky and hasn't caught it. Or at least that's what she thinks. On the day of her tenth birthday, she goes into the kitchen for her family's famous chocolate birthday pancakes, only her mother hasn't cooked them and doesn't even know who Ruby is. She takes her into the garage and sends in Ruby's father to get to the bottom of this, but he doesn't know who she is either and calls the police. The police don't come. Instead Psi agents do and take her away to a camp. \n As it turns out, if the children don't get IANN, or they survive it, it means that they are 'special.' Ruby has a special ability to make people forget things and when she is sent for classification she makes her tester forget what type she has and is labeled a Green - they use a rainbow scale to determine how dangerous a kid's ability is Red being the most dangerous, Blue being the least. Six years later, thanks to a White Noise test - a high pitched frequency that only the psi kids can hear and causes them to go immobile - Ruby is sent to the medical wing where she learns the shocking truth. The Psi guards have been testing out a new frequency to pick up any Red, Orange or Yellows that they might have missed. But lucky for Ruby, her nurse doesn't work for the Psi Guard she works for the Children's League and has every intention of getting her out before the guard kills her. But Rub knows that help always comes with a price. \n I came across the book multiple times whenever I went into the book tag on Pinterest. I read the summary once and wasn't sure this would be my kind of book, but a lot of my bookish friends told me that I should give it a go. I'm glad I took them up on their advice.

But the ones that survive, mutate in a way that they gain some sort of powers. The government took the kids that survived (with the permission of his parents or not) into camps that supposedly can rehabilitate the kids, but in reality they just lived oppressed. The kids are divided in color: green are the super smart ones, blue the ones with telekinesis, yellow the ones that can control electricity, red the ones that control fire, and orange the ones that can use mind powers. Ruby is an orange, but is living in a camp as a green. She is scared of her powers, of the monster that she believes she is and what her powers accidentally did to her loved ones. \n I LOVED this book. A dystopian book about super powers? Count me in! \n What I liked about this book: the world, the setting, the characters, the powers. I loved Ruby; she was strong, smart, but flawed. She exasperated me at times but not to the point of disliking her. I also loved Liam, Chubs and Zu. Liam was perfect, sweet and strong but also reckless and sincere. He was a lovable flawed love interest. I hope we see every character develop even more in the next books. \n And then there is Clancy. What a fascinating character. I had a feeling he was going to turn out to be an antagonist, but I didn't anticipate him being likable, in a way that you hate him but also enjoy reading about him. \n I can't wait to see how the story continues!""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

I\'m not sure what exactly I was looking for, but I just wanted more. \n There were so many aspects I feel very neutral about. The concept and back story were interesting, but it\'s something we have all seen before. The plot was extremely slow paced. I found the ending to be very fast, but overall pretty predictable. The characters were believable, but I didn\'t find myself getting attached to them until the very end. The romance elements felt a little off. Overall, this book just left me feeling ""meh."" I have no strong feelings either way about it. \n I would categorize this book as more of a ""survivalist"" story than a dystopian. The world feels more post-apocalyptic than anything else, so fans of that kind of storyline will probably enjoy this. The characters felt very realistic as well, so if you prefer character driven stories, I would recommend this. \n I do plan on continuing with the series, but as of right now, I am in no rush to do so. I hope the next book picks up the pace a little more and is less predictable.

The beginning and end were great, but the rest when she finally finds Slip Kid and gets to East River (a safe place for kids like her) was kind of pointless. And the characters. I liked Chubs, Liam and Zu, but I couldn\'t really connect with Ruby. Her inability to stand up for herself and refusal to use her powers was frustrating to read. This gets slightly better towards the end but still. \n What I did like was world building and introduction. This world was filled with new concepts, societies and powers. I loved the concept of their abilities and I\'m always up for telekinetic ass kicking even if that only happened at the beginning and the end .

I'd been seeing this book get nothing but glowing reviews from people on Goodreads, so my expectations were pretty high and I had been looking forward to it for a while. Unfortunately though, my wait just seemed to end with nothing but disappointment. \n I'll start with the positives, since this book really isn't completely terrible. I really enjoyed the overall concept, kids with powers, hitler style concentration camps, camp breakouts, different classes of powers. The whole thing felt very dystopian meets X-Men, and in the beginning I was kind of enjoying it...but then the middle came. \n Now the middle of this book is basically our cast of characters searching for somewhere, which leads to lots of meandering exposition. I stuck with it because reviews had mentioned that the last 100 pages were brilliant, but while I thought they were better than what came before, they weren't good or interesting enough (for me) to save the book from a two 'it was okay' star rating. I was torn enough to ALMOST give it a three, but then I realised I have very little intention of picking up the sequel, so I can't really say I liked it. \n It was the characters that were the biggest letdown here. I've read enough YA now that a book really can just die without an interesting main or side character to draw me in, and this book just didn't deliver on that. I'd even go as far as to say that I found the main character, Ruby, kind of annoying. I found her to be weak, and without a backbone, always doubting herself when she was one of the more powerful (let's call them) mutants about. The side characters then, while less annoying, were just a little bland, and I didn't get attached to them. It also took me about two weeks to finish this book, which is unusual for me as I tend to fly through things pretty fast, but this just proves that it was lacking that 'hook'. \n Now it's easy to focus on the bad points when writing a review, so I'd like to point out that this book really isn't that terrible. The writing is generally really good, and I can even see why people enjoy it. I also seem to be one of the few people who didn't love this, so I'm just going to go ahead and call this a 'it's me, not you' book. I was disappointed, but you might not be, we will just leave it at that.""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

I really like that trilogy (well, books 1 & 2 so far). So many parts of it, even in the last few pages when Ruby talks about feeling like she\'s unwinding (she means it in a different, but still similar way). If you like those books, you will like this book. My main complaint with the Unwind series was that there wasn\'t much movement. The Darkest Minds doesn\'t have that problem. There was movement, it wasn\'t a bunch of the same thing, waiting for the story to start, getting to the end and realizing that was the story. However..... the ending. I don\'t know if the ending makes me want to bump this book up to 5 stars or drop it down to 1. Because HOW COULD THE AUTHOR DO THAT TO ME?! I\'m pretty oblivious, never see twists coming, etc. so maybe I should\'ve seen how Ruby would fix this. In hindsight, it is the most obvious solution. It reminds me of One Flew Over The Cuckoo\'s Nest (which also, has lines talking about rabbits accepting their fate, at least in the play - I\'m pretty sure they reference Watership Down). It crushed me. CRUSHED ME. Nearly had my 4 y.o. in tears because I was sobbing, sitting next to him, barely able to choke out, while pointing at the book, ""It\'s okay. It\'s just a sad, sad story."" I mean, it snuck up on me. I thought things were somehow going to be okay. Then they weren\'t. I haven\'t read the blurb for book 2 yet, but I can\'t understand how there can possibly be a sequel without Liam. My husband, not knowing anything about the book, but being very intuitive and hard to pull a twist past, said, ""It was all a dream!"" That made me think, ""She didn\'t erase herself from his memories. She just adjusted them so they could get through this tight spot & they\'ll meet on the flip side. OR she didn\'t erase herself. She coached him so that he\'d look like it, somehow, and he was essentially faking the memory loss."" That\'s what I\'m going to go with this ending which I hate. \n ETA: I read the blurb for book 2 (Never Fade). I figured out that I don\'t really think this book was about Ruby, it was about Ruby AND Liam AND Chubs and the relationships between them all. Without Liam, Ruby isn\'t much of a character! How can this 2nd book work without Liam, specifically without a Liam/Ruby relationship, preferably with Chubs there, too?! \n It\'s been a few hours and I\'m still in a daze, in denial. This is tearing my heart out. :-( . \n I recommend that if you are this kind of person: \n you wait until October 2013 to read this so that Never Fade will be out when you finish. Just a bit of advice. \n ETA: I\'m bumping this up to 5 stars. Anything that was on the brink of 5 stars that has me obsessing about it this long after finishing it \n deserves a bump up.'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

Ruby Daly is the heroic protagonist, that\'s lived in fear her whole life of ""being a monster"" escapes Thurmond, runs in hiding with people that promised her safety and help. Which turns out to be total false. Escapes again and falls into the arms of three strangers who are like her and escape for...I would say the very same thing she\'s trying to run from minus all the other reasons why they are running from too... \n Okay, now that\'s maybe the first few chapters, then in a way my suspense went down hill. Don\'t get me wrong this book overall was very intriguing in ways I\'d admire.There were a couple of chapters...let me just say were long, and some chapters kept going on and on about things I felt were to shallow.At this point I was already drawn to Liam & Ruby; a love triangle that ,didn\'t really get nowhere...then went somewhere...but not exactly where I wanted them to go.But I continued their adventure, and fallowed through with disappointing things that made me hate some characters, and then some. I didn\'t know who to hate at this point: The Children\'s League or the PSF\'s...then it really makes you question who\'s really the good heros PSF\'S or the Childrens League. Hopefully I will come to surfaces with that in the next book, strangely at this point after reading halfway down the middle of this book each one thought that finding the Slip Kid would be their safety net and not only that but their savior. Turns out all the ""Slip Kid"" was, wsd a silly douche of an offspring to the president that\'s help orchestrated this whole fiasco with kids who are deadly. Then after reading nearly towards the end, it became once again interesting. But...but...NO!!! Zu,who was strange but I\'ve learned to adore, departures strangely in one chapter, and was never herd from again. I get it she left with her cousin to go to California with yellows , but I just thought it was bad timing for her to leave; they all needed to be together. After, Ruby reunited with Liam after his brutal attack that Clancy aka the Slip Kid had done...it couldn\'t have gotten worse. After so much turmoil these kids suffer enough. Enough was never Enough!!! The task that finally would relieve so closure for Chubs was cut short by a bullet...at this point I\'m already beyond frustrated. Just when I thought the worse was yet to come...it kept going. No running away laying on the beach for Liam & Ruby; instead that\'s to be concluded into the next book. ARGH!!!! \n Overall, I give it four in a half, because it was good, usually with these types of story it\'s about a three. I mean it could have gone there with the way it was taking me to finish this book. But in the end, it did satisfy me on some levels; were I will meet with the other conclusion in yhe next chapter.'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

I didn\'t mark it as DNF b/c I wasn\'t totally writing it off. I was just putting it aside for later. WAY later. So when people started talking about The Darkest Minds last year, I didn\'t pay much attention. \n Then one of my favorite writers reviewed it as THEBESTBOOKEVEROMG!! So I bought it when it came out. And it sat on a shelf for a year. \n Then a bunch of bloggers started reviewing it. A year later. And they\'re all THEBESTBOOKEVEROMG!! So I just had to jump on that bandwagon to see what I\'d been missing. \n *throws book at wall* \n The Darkest Minds is about a generation of youth who are born with superhero-like abilities. The additional abilities are jump-started at the onset of puberty. The kids who don\'t die when their brains basically EXPLODE, are bused to government camps where they are ""rehabilitated."" There are five divisions of abilities: \n Green: super smarts \n Blue: telekinesis \n Yellow: manipulation of electricity \n Orange: mind control \n Red: fire starters \n Greens and Blues are safe, Yellows are in the middle, and Oranges and Reds are frickin\' dangerous. Ruby (our MC) is an Orange, but she gets placed with the Greens (which is good b/c Big Brother starts killing off Oranges when they can\'t be ""rehabilitated""). If you\'re wondering why I keep putting ""rehabilitated"" in quotations, it\'s b/c I still don\'t know what it\'s supposed to mean. Lots of things are alluded to in reference to the camps and what happens there: scientific experiments (electro-shock therapy style), isolation, sensory deprivation, rape-as-punishment by the a**hole guards, but all of those things are in reference to studying/exploitation, not ""curing"" an ""illness."" \n And I don\'t know about you guys, but sometimes when I start reading a book, I immediately have issues with it. In The Darkest Minds, my first issue was that there is a line that you can point to (like B.C. and B.C.E.) and on one side you have normal kids, and on the other side you have mutant freaks. Every single kid. BUT . . . wait for it . . . only AMERICAN kids. \n Eh?? \n Because last time I checked, Americans (myself included) were a bunch of mutts. The fact that I know I\'m 25% Lithuanian is HUGE. Hardly anyone is a full quarter of anything in America. My other 75% is half a dozen different nationalities THAT I KNOW OF. If it were kids of Western European descent or Eastern European or Asian, etc. I could maybe buy into the whole idea (but it would still be hard b/c these things happen over time, NOT immediately), but it\'s not. It\'s just Americans. \n Willful Suspension of Disbelief only works if the subject is remotely believable. \n So that was a huge problem for me. Almost as big as the previously mentioned rape-as-punishment allusion. Not cool ever. REALLY not cool in a YA book. A girl covers for her friend and mouths off to the guards which results in the girl getting gang-raped for two days. \n *retrieves book to throw it at wall again* \n And then there\'s the triangle. The only reason I picked up on the ""interest"" between Ruby and Boy1 was b/c all of a sudden someone\'s staring at someone else\'s lips. But that wasn\'t terrible. I liked Boy1 and once I knew what was going on, I was cool with it. But then there\'s Boy2, and you would have to be an absolute idiot to not immediately know that Boy2 is the BAD GUY. \n But somehow there were enough twists and turns to keep me reading. Up until the point where I was 50 pages away from finishing the nearly 500 page book, anyway, and then I just kept going b/c I\'m STUBBORN. \n And I really wish I hadn\'t. I really wish I had quit b/c those last 50 pages made it impossible for me not the read the next book. Sigh . . . \n HOWEVER, all of this doesn\'t necessarily mean that you will also hate it. I wasn\'t crazy about The 5th Wave by Rick Yancey either, so I would suggest that if you liked Yancey\'s book, you\'ll probably like this one (to me, both books had a similar overall feel). My biggest objection was only alluded to, and very briefly at that. And maybe there\'s a perfectly rational explanation for why only American kids mutate and I\'m to obtuse to see it. It wouldn\'t be the first time. So if SciFi/Dystopians are your thing, give it a shot. But if they aren\'t . . .'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something frightening enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that got her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government ""rehabilitation camp.""

She is on the run, desperate to find the only safe haven left for kids like her--East River. She joins a group of kids who have escaped their own camp.

Depending on you power you where put into groups of color: Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red being the most dangerous of them all. Ruby is an Orange hidden away as green. She uses her power to trick them. The thing about Ruby is she could never control her power ..well more like never tried. She was more scared of her self then anything else. She can read peoples minds and even take away their memory's. She tries her best to never touch people. To her if she just listens to the rules and does what she is told she will be fine. \n six years later. these people break her out with warning that she was caught and they will kill her. Not having any choice, she escapes out of the camp. Ruby soon after realizes that they are lying to her and keeping something from her. so she runs from them. \n Ruby comes across a little girl name Zue and two boys named Liam and Chubs. They set off to East River to find the Slip Kid, a place rumored to be a save zone for kids like them. On there adventure she tries to keep her power a secret and lies to them even tho she is slowly falling in love with Liam. The book tricks you into thinking there is a love triangle but no..oh no far from a love triangle. Ruby learns she can't trust the people in East Rivers and lets just say the other guys is a huge A-Hole. \n The ending of the book was really sad. You watch Ruby grow more towards the end. In the beginning she was more stand off-ish but when you get towards the end you see that she becomes more brave and strong. She does what ever she can to keep the people she cares for save even it meant to make them forget. \n I really enjoyed the book a lot. Another book this week that i couldn't find much flaws. The writing was really good and so is the characters. I highly recommend this book. I don't know if its cause i just really like dystopian's or what but this week has been a good week of reading. I hope you guys enjoy this book like i did. The book is good from the beginning to the shocking ending. I really can not wait to get my hands on the 2nd book.

I don't know if my mind can ever fully process this book and it's complexity and beauty. \n Alexandra Bracken has really gone above and beyond with this book. I can see why the internet and bookshops exploded with the release of this novel. \n In this world, children are affected by a disease specifically targeting them before puberty. Many children develop talents, powers, and aren't even aware of what they're doing till later on. Blamed by adults and government officials, they are corralled and taken away to the equivalent of concentration camps, where they are classified into levels by color--red, orange, yellow, blue. Many are killed, but some live and are studied in these camps, suppressed and kept from their families. It isn't until a rebel cause helps Ruby escape that the action begins, but the outside world with all her freedom is just as suffocating and gilded as those camps were and everywhere she turns someone wants to use Ruby for her powers or kill her because of them. \n As one of the last surviving orange-level minds out there, Ruby is dangerous because of what she knows and what she can do. Reaching into others' minds, she not only sees their memories but knows their darkest secrets, the blackness of their hatred, and evil can come in ordinary and extraordinary. But being told you're evil for most of your life and refusing yourself human touch can leave its mark. In her quest to save the world, including her love, Ruby gives him and her freedom up. \n My emotions were all over the place. This story is one of those that can be for young adults or full grown men. Yes, there is a love-factor as almost all stories nowadays do, but the overall storyline and takeaway message is so much bigger than a teenager romance or heartbreak, and I think everyone could benefit from reading this at some point in their lives. \n This book touches on human ignorance, fear, power, how we treat one another, and of course is on-par with the dystopian societies. As I write this review I can think back on parts of the story that touched me, areas where I had to actually stop reading to take some time to think about what was being said or to pull myself together and others where I was so engrossed that the world fell away.""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something frightening enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that got her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government ""rehabilitation camp."" She might have survived the mysterious disease that had killed most of America's children, but she and the others emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they could not control.
Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones. When the truth comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. She is on the run, desperate to find the only safe haven left for kids like her--East River. She joins a group of kids who have escaped their own camp.

Almost every time I opened Tumblr, there was some sort of edit for the series on my dash. Goodreads continued recommending it to me. Libraries had absurd numbers of holds for it. \n I've never been a huge fan of dystopias in general, which is probably why I waited so long to pick up The Darkest Minds. True, it came with glowing reviews and a unique premise - children all over the country are dying, and the ones who aren't are sent to horrible government camps where they're sorted according to special abilities and distinguished by color - but even though I love special powers in books, I couldn't pull myself past the whole dystopia thing. \n Until this book. I never should have waited so long. \n The Darkest Minds may start off with the heroine, Ruby, in a brutal camp, as bleak and brutal as promised, but as we learn that she is an Orange, someone who can mess with other people's minds, we also learn how dangerous and useful someone like her can be. Having lied about her color classification, Ruby and another orange are smuggled out of her camp by a mysterious woman before anyone can realize what they can do, but the twists start up again when Ruby escapes from her rescuers. At this point in the book, she joins up with a small group of other escapees from another camp to travel all over Virginia in search of East River, both a place where escaped kids can be safe and where they can find the elusive Slip Kid, rumored to be able to get kids in touch with families. \n Ruby is the sort of heroine who both empathizes with others but also can distance herself from them. True, she makes some questionable decisions - sometimes on a whim - but she isn't the type to be blinded by love and be so consumed that she can't think straight. (Once you've read the book, particularly the ending, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.) The main love interest, Liam, is also empathetic, and his open heart and confidence in helping out all the other kids is such a nice change from the bad boys of literature. He's an absolute sweetie. His friend Chubs starts off on a bit of a sour note, but he eventually develops a solid friendship with Ruby. And of course, Zu, who may be emotionally scarred but is adorable and loyal and loves everything pink. \n Throughout the course of the novel, the reader glimpses small bits of Ruby's memories from her past, and immediately we are given the sense that something went wrong before she was sent to her camp. These details come in pieces, as do many other details, something that works so well. No information is simply dumped on the reader; instead, we're left to figure things out for ourselves and/or wait for the clues to all come together. This might make it sound like there is a lot of assumption involved, but Bracken does such a good job of weaving in clues that we never feel like we're completely in the dark. It's refreshing to have a lack of details that are just given. The voice is much more authentic. \n I thought the end of The Darkest Minds was going in such a different direction (just as it started looking a little less bleak, BAM)...(I hope that wasn't a spoiler)...but then there are several twists, one right after another. I'm still a little bit in a state of shock from the end, and I'm absolutely going to have to start reading the sequel immediately to know what comes of that final twist! \n Even if you aren't typically into dystopian novels, pick up The Darkest Minds. It's refreshing, original, and witty - definitely worth all the hype!""",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

Flip a coin to decide with feeling is overwhelmingly more than the other. I guess I can do that, or I can simply just speak my mind... (Insert Mulan gif here). \n Anyway, I find The Darkest Mind slightly confusing. Okay, more than that. It totally befuddled me from the very beginning, and I pretty much want to slam Ruby\'s head (along with Liam\'s head, and Clancy\'s head, and pretty much every freakin\' character\'s head) in a wall, because I just don\'t like this book. Every word of it is like that White Noise Ruby speaks of. So annoying, ear piercing. (And I\'m probably a Green, because it doesn\'t affect me so much). \n And I really don\'t like how the author holds back information about the Green, Blue, Orange, and Red system. It is so annoyingly annoying, and I really hate it. Really, really, really. It is as annoying as all of these ""annoying""s and ""really""s I put in this review. (Please notice that they do have a point in this review). \n But let\'s get into the color system. Green and Blue aren\'t very dangerous. Green is highly intelligent and probably has photographic memory. Blue is super strong and has telekinesis and some other powers, I assume. Orange can manipulate minds. And there is that other color, which I presume is the deadliest of them all. Red. What does Red do? I have no idea, but I find it interesting that Ruby\'s name is Ruby (isn\'t that redundant?). Ruby, of course, is the gem that gives off a color of red. Curious, I must say. \n And now, let\'s move onto Ruby. \n I guess I don\'t exactly like Ruby (underestimation of the year, I admit). She is a bit too innocent and not as clever as I would like her to be. (But she technically isn\'t a Green, soo...). Anyway, I thought after a person experiences so much hardship, she/he would be a bit more careful. No one sleeps very easy at night. I know I don\'t. After a freaking earthquake, I\'m as scared as a cat in the rain. One false sign of it, and I\'m running out of the door. The thing is... I remember things like that, and I will not want to experience it again. So I think Ruby would be much less trusting (which is perhaps an aspect of her character that makes me question her very existence). Plus... where is her eyes? \n I mean, where is her eyes? Or her gut? \n Anyway, I think I should end this review before I really start ranting with crass words. The Darkest Minds is not for me, and I really don\'t enjoy it (or writing this review). \n Rating: One out of Five'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

It was a pretty good book with the exception of one rather glaring issue--Ruby. \n Ruby was such a hot and cold character; one moment you would admire her courage and intelligence yet the next her pushover attitude might make you want to yank your--or her--hair out. Although some may see her bravery mixed with bouts of cowardice as something that made her more \'real\', I found the clash of personality traits too inconsistent and jumbled, and was left grasping at wisps of random characteristics, wondering who exactly is Ruby? \n Moreover, I hated how she let one particular character dictate what she should do because I knew that particular character was bad news from the start--and I\'m sure I\'m not the only one who guessed it right. On the bright side, the decisions Ruby made at the end of the book were very redeeming. It gave me some newfound hope that maybe--just maybe--she could live up to her full potential in the following books. \n Apart from the problem of an unsatisfying protagonist, The Darkest Minds had been an interesting and adventurous read. Following Ruby, Liam, Chubs and Zu on their journey to find East River had been exhilarating and the abundant dangers, I wished I had been right there in their midst! The bond between the four of them was also extremely well-developed. Although they had not been fast friends, specifically Ruby and Chubs, it was lovely watching their friendships grow as they learn to trust and count on one another. Admittedly, the camaraderie depicted here was one of the most touching I\'ve read of! \n Each of the other major characters were wonderfully colorful too. Liam: the trusting and kind leader. Chubs: the skeptical, intelligent, annoying--but fondly so--one, sort of like a mom. And Zu: the shy little girl who\'s like a beacon of hope to everyone else. They might all be damaged in some way due to the world they lived in but seeing that such a hard life had not broken them was both impressive and inspiring. Especially Liam, who can still be cheery, positive and selfless in spite of the atrocities he had witnessed. \n As for the world-building, it was okay; polished but not very believable. Or well, it would remain rather unbelievable until we find out the cause of Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (IAAN), the disease in the novel which killed off most of America\'s children and left the surviving ones with various types of special abilities. And no, the cause will not be revealed in this first book so we have to wait (not-so-patiently). \n To sum it up, The Darkest Minds had been a really enjoyable read and regardless of the issues I had with it, the way it had concluded was beautiful, albeit heartbreaking. I loved how it showed Ruby has learned from the experiences she was put through and hinted at a much more proactive and strong protagonist in the next installment. Honestly though, I might\'ve liked the whole book better if I\'d had the time to read it within a fewer number of days and not been so occupied with school assignments. \n P.S. There\'s a part in the book where Ruby sees a vandalism which only wrote ""Matthew 19:14"" and nothing else. For those of you who don\'t have a Bible, I\'ve searched up the verse for you: \n Jesus said, ""Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.""'",4.25,"When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed.

I like that her background gives us a bit more commentary on privilege and that her unease with her growing feelings allows the romance to burn slowly. \n Favorite Line \n ""All you can do is make your decisions based on what you know now."" \n It\'s not especially ""new,"" but I appreciate that this is repeated and gives both girls strength and self-confidence. Plus, it\'s too true. \n Fun Author Fact \n Malinda Lo is a rockstar and does a lot (A LOT) about queerness in YA. For the past few years, she\'s pulled together all the numbers she can on published books with queer characters to show how representation is lacking. Here is her post for 2014. \n Is this worth a book hangover? \n I think so - it\'s a fun adventure and the romance is perfect - a slow burn with lots of feeling behind it so when you finally get there, it\'s super satisfying.

Our two queer POV heroines share a quest to restore the natural balance of their kingdom, but maintain very different stances on duty, learning, ""home,"" and goals for the future. Taisin has to reach her full potential, and decide whether her teachers are an absolute authority or just a starting point; Kaede discovers that musle memory, physical discipline, and a sharp blade can trump meditation when it comes to saving the day. The world is well-drawn, the I Ching-based magic is satisfyingly logical, and the monsters are a perfect mix of horrifying or tragic, mindless or far too self-aware. \n The plot won\'t be new to most American or Western European readers - save the kingdom from the disruptive ecological effect of an ice queen! as seen in Andersen, Narnia, Jones\' Tough Guide to Fairyland, ""Frozen,"" etc.! - but the characters have an explicitly Chinese view of the situation. Irish fairy favorites - the Sidhe and the Wild Hunt - become the largely unknown Xi and a bunch of pale folks with bows and horses. Celtic imagery and Gaelic script get assessed by our protagonists as ""strange"" and ""unreadable."" Kaede & Taisin\'s lack of context for stories about changelings and the Seelie Court creates a really refreshing adventure instead of just a tired re-tread of European fairy-tale tropes.

I listened to this one on audio, provided by Brilliance Audio and both the writing and the narration were excellent. There\'s so much to love about this book. Children named after book characters, a coming out story, a family tragedy and grief to deal with, and a hopeful ending that ""all will be well."" Different, but well. Accidental deaths always draw blame and guilt and Knowles handles this perfectly. The recovery time is a bit compressed due to the limitations of a novel, but the stages of grief are there. I especially like the repeated assurance of ""It\'s no one\'s fault"" that doubles as a subtle reassurance about Holden\'s homosexuality. It is just is. No one is to blame.

The first half is very good too, mostly dealing with the main character Fern\'s 14-year-old brother Holden being gay and everyone in his family kind of knowing but Holden not wanting to talk about it. Fern (who\'s 12) is the closest to her brother and has a pretty kick-ass but scary day when she sits at the back of the bus and realizes what the bullying is like for her brother at school (including a nasty school bus driver who supports the bullies!). Fern\'s dealing with some of her own stuff too: starting middle school, trying to sort out what her feelings for her guy best friend are, finding out where her place in her big family is, feeling invisible and underappreciated. \n All the characters in this family are lovingly fleshed out: Sara, the oldest at 19 who\'s a Deadhead wannabe with dreads who tells it like it is and sometimes offers truths that are a little too harsh; Mom, who\'s an old hippie who cooks vegetarian food and escapes to her meditation room above the family restaurant when things get too crazy; Dad, who\'s super keen (embarassingly so) on improving his restaurant, dragging his kids and wife along for humiliation in the form of cheesy ads featuring the family; Holden, 14 and angsty and in the closet, storming out whenever he can\'t take his family but also fiercely protective of his younger sister and super into fashion; Fern, 12, feeling like she\'s kind of caught between childhood and teenagehood, feeling undervalued and invisible in her big family but underneath super brave and loving; Charlie, 3 and the ""accidental"" baby who is a bit of a terror, always sticky and smelly and wanting everyone to play with him when they\'re all really busy and have better things to do. \n So you get to know all these characters so well, and their family dynamic, and then halfway through the book Charlie dies. I knew something like this happened in the book (probably from reading a review at some point) but I was still reeling after it happened. I can\'t imagine what it would be like to read this if you had no idea there was going to be a death. As I already said, it\'s just heartbreaking and made me cry over and over again. Knowles does such an amazing job of depicting how each member of the family deals with their grief. We see everything from Fern\'s perspective, who at times doesn\'t understand the different ways that everyone is trying to cope; she\'s especially devastated at how her mother emotionally disappears just when Fern and her siblings really need her. She\'s also racked with guilt over having been watching Charlie when the accident that leads to his death happens, convinced it is her fault. \n Slowly, slowly at the end of the book, their family begins to pick up their lives again, and Knowles ultimately leaves the reader with the idea that while things will never be the same again, there is hope and happiness in the future of their family (including for Holden, who eventually comes out to his family and goes to the school dance with another boy!). And then if you\'re like me you cry again at the end, but happy tears this time.'",4.11,"Starting middle school brings all the usual challenges -- until the unthinkable happens, and Fern and her family must find a way to heal.
Twelve-year-old Fern feels invisible. It seems as though everyone in her family has better things to do than pay attention to her: Mom (when she's not meditating) helps Dad run the family restaurant; Sarah is taking a gap year after high school; and Holden pretends that Mom and Dad and everyone else doesn't know he's gay, even as he fends off bullies at school. Then there's Charlie: three years old, a ""surprise"" baby, the center of everyone's world. He's devoted to Fern, but he's annoying, too, always getting his way, always dirty, always commanding attention. If it wasn't for Ran, Fern's calm and positive best friend, there'd be nowhere to turn. Ran's mantra, ""All will be well,"" is soothing in a way that nothing else seems to be.

With that said, this product I believe is intended for children 10 and up. I have an almost 9 year old who is a very advanced reader and I do not believe this would be an appropriate book for her. Way to much on the romance side of things regarding Fang Dylan and Max. \n With that out of the way, while I would worry about how appropriate it was for a young audience, I personally really enjoyed it. This book is great closure. I love that in the end I was not left with a plethora of unanswered questions. One of the biggest reveals for me was the identity of The Voice, and I am so happy this was included. \n Max stayed true to character. She showed her continued softening, but never lost her ability to lead. She remains a strong heroine, which is very welcome. She wasn't quite as headstrong and stubborn as she has been in the past, there is definite character growth where she is concerned. Her choice of priorities in the end was admirable and believable, and really helped sell me on the story. \n At times I did think it was a bit to cliche, injuries were just to inconsequential, answers were a little to easy, but it is after all a children's book. \n The pacing was fantastic. The length did leave a bit to be desired, but again, I am an adult reader. I don't think the length would have annoyed me as much had the last 13% of the product not been a preview of a different book. It really makes it deceptive about the true length of the book you are buying. The actual story stops on 344, not 380.

I had purchased it months ago at Walmart with the intent to read, so this just gave me a good opportunity. \n I purposely did not know much about the book before starting. I never read the synopsis and did not read reviews. \n I was surprised at the overall feel of the book after I had finished and reflected. Everyone constantly says it\'s ""Not a zombie book,"" and I can wholeheartedly agree with that now - at the end it felt much more akin to Susan Beth Pfeffer\'s Life As We Knew It or Meg Rosoff\'s How I Live Now - survival in spite of zombies. \n The beginning half of the book is quite different from the last half, as the setting drastically changes partway through due to circumstances the characters experience. I enjoyed the second half more than the first, but this could also be because by the second half you are much more invested in the characters. \n My biggest gripe with The Forest of Hands and Teeth is that often days or weeks would go by with no mention, and I prefer to have a continuous story. Though I suppose having a few weeks of living with no extraordinary events is realistic - it just feels less likely to me in a dystopian setting. \n I\'m interested to see how the second and third books go. I\'ve had readers tell me they enjoyed the second (Dead Tossed Waves) many more times than the first, with the third (Dark and Hollow Places) being a perfect ending to the trilogy - this is very exciting to me because I quite enjoyed The Forest of Hands and Teeth as it was. \n Very recommended to Susan Beth Pfeffer fans - or, if you\'ve read The Forest of Hands and Teeth, I recommend you try the Pfeffer books.

One of the reviews that I read months later said that Twilight signaled the new ""in"" subject in YA - vampires. They were the ""new zombies;"" and zombies were ""out."" \n I had never read any books about zombies, for two reasons. First, Robin McKinley has never written a book about them. Second, I am a wimp. A big one. I saw ""Poltergeist"" when I was 19 and I still have nightmares about it. Forget ""Thriller."" Undead doesn\'t do it for me. \n Keep that in mind, then, when I say that I almost couldn\'t finish The Forest of Hands and Teeth by Carrie Ryan. Her writing is intelligent and sure-handed. Her descriptions are vivid without being verbose. Her zombies jump off the page and try to eat my brains. Oh, wait. \n The Forest of Hands and Teeth introduces Mary, a teenager who lives in a dystopian future. The rules set by the Sisterhood are clear - stay inside the gates, away from the undead who run free in the forest. But when tragedy strikes and Mary must join the Sisterhood against her will, she finds herself thinking about what might lie beyond the fence. \n I really want to be able to tell you more, but then I would have to feed you to the undead. Instead, watch this trailer: \n Truly, I am lucky beyond lucky to even have gotten my hands on the ARC of this book. The fantastic Sharon at ""Sharon Loves Books and Cats"" chose me as the default winner of her early January giveaway. The day I received the ARC in the mail, I put the kids to bed and then stayed up late to read the whole gosh darn book. And then I stayed up late because I couldn\'t sleep. I\'m not sure how to eruditely say, ""I was creeped out."" \n Having said that, however, I also want to say that Forest of Hands and Teeth was not a slasher brain candy kind of story. Ryan\'s characterization of Mary shows the depth of a perceptive, complex teenager. Her relationships are not easily defined, and her penchant for questioning authority puts her in frightening situations. \n The only hesitation I have in totally recommending this book is its ambiguity concerning religion and spirituality. This is an occupational hazard and if I ever wrote a book Ryan would probably say the same thing about my grasp of law. The Sisterhood which governs the village seems to take its reference from the sisterhood of Catholic nuns; the Bible Mary is forced to read seems to be the Christian Bible. Because the purpose and power of the Sisterhood are so roundly questioned in the first part of the book, I expected religion and spirituality to be a theme throughout. Mary expresses her disdain for this religion in which she\'s been brought up, but there\'s no further development. Since my field is religion, I would have liked to have seen these thread continue throughout the story. \n Then again, maybe Ryan will explore it more in the second installment of Mary\'s story, which will be released in 2010. And maybe by then I\'ll have desensitized enough that I can enjoy Ryan\'s excellent writing without resenting the fact that she writes well enough to bring zombies into my bedroom. \n So. I highly rate this book, despite the fact that I do not consider zombie stories pleasant reading. Whoever said zombies were ""out"" is in for a shock when Forest of Hands and Teeth is released March 10. I\'ll leave it up to you whether it\'s a pleasant shock or not, but thanks to Carrie Ryan, zombies are definitely back ""in.""'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

I hoped and wished that Mary would just DIE. \n The concept of the book is entirely unoriginal and seems to have been molded around M. Night Shamalamawhatever\'s ""The Village"". While the rest of the world seemed to hate that movie, I liked the idea and enjoyed the movie pretty much. I got that vibe while reading this book and I could have lived with--and even enjoyed--this book in all its unoriginal glory. \n BUT.... \n The author managed to create the most unlikeable character ever in this novel, and lucky for us readers, it was our boring, whiney, bipolar, selfish, stupid protagonist, Mary. There are so many things terribly painful about this book, that I\'m sure they\'ve already been written in reviews before, but I have to touch on a few. \n 1. Point of View. The author didn\'t do anyone any favors by writing in first person present point of view. Instead of an entertaining story, we get pages and pages and pages of what\'s going on inside Mary\'s head. First person present can work extremely well, but there wasn\'t enough actually going on in the story, so instead, we get front row seats to the spectacle that is Mary\'s inner thoughts. And all this chick thinks about is Travis, the ocean, her mother, and other things masked as philosophical ponderings. \n 2. Mary is a psycho. This chick has issues. First of all, dumb as rocks and though she constantly wonders what is outside the fence and what life used to hold, she is completely oblivious to things around her. She is the most selfish protagonist I\'ve ever seen (and I heard people call Katniss selfish... they should check this hot mess out!). All she thought about was Travis and the ocean, and was either hurting those people around her who\'ve been there for her since childhood, or putting everyone in danger all the time just so she could have her way. I found it impossible to root for her, and it broke my heart to find out that the series continues, because it means she won\'t die at the end. \n 3. Love/obsession triangle. This is not love. This is insanity, low self-esteem, bipolar mood swings, and a complete disregard for anything resembling respect. Her connection to these guys since childhood should have formed a stronger bond with them, especially since the population is so small, but there appears to be no strong connection between anyone here. Harry and Travis are brothers, and yet they show zero loyalty to one another, and betray the other without even thinking twice. Mary\'s confusing obsession with Travis is sickening, something like infatuation, but so up and down I\'m wondering where her medications are. Her ""friendship"" with Cass supposedly went back many many years, and yet she has no shame in her actions with Travis. In one sentence, she\'s describing how she can\'t live without Travis, and the next she\'s fuming over the sight of Cass and Harry, and then she\'s livid over Cass and Travis... and it never stops. This chick has major issues. This girl represents everything that I want my daughter to NOT become. I may even use this book as an example of a pathetic and embarrassing excuse for a woman (and lead character!). \n 4. Everything else. It just was terrible. I was pretty invested even up until about halfway, and had this book at around 3 stars, despite Mary\'s character flaws. I liked the concept enough. And to the author\'s credit, her writing in terms of sentence structure and flow was actually not bad. But then it all went terribly downhill. \n Towards the end of the book I was really hoping that Jed would get Cass and Jacob out and safe. Cass had an epiphany at the end and I liked her mothering instincts actually. That is about the only thing believable and likeable about this book. \n I skimmed the last 20 pages or so of the book since I was nodding off, and found myself jumping with joy when I finally closed the book and could say I was done. I have never read Twilight, but after watching the movies, I see a similarity in pathetic characteristic between Bella and this Mary chick. I don\'t want to read or see pathetic. It\'s disgusting and uninteresting. I won\'t be reading the others, and I am going to immediately pick up something else and try and flush this waste of time out of my brain.'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

Most unwise. This book is gripping. This book you cannot put down. Let\'s just admit I read this book in one day, finishing late into the night. \n This is young adult zombie book, which may make you want to run for the hills, but I found it entertaining. The story is a cross between Dawn of the Dead and the movie The Village. It centers around Mary, who has grown up knowing only her village, surrounded by fences and with the hum of the undead moaning around the forest. Her village is presided over by the Sisterhood, a shadowy religious group which keeps everyone in line. The books begins with Mary\'s mother, distraught over the loss of her husband to the Forest of Hands and Teeth, being lost to the zombies. Don\'t slap me, this really isn\'t a spoiler as it happens on page one and starts the book off. Mary is thrown into different difficult situations until the unthinkable occurs and she is off on her own trying to survive in the terrifying forest. \n Positives for me was the suspense in the book. It was gripping and well-done. The sisterhood is shadowy and scary, and weird things are going on everywhere. It is easy to lose yourself in this world, and the author makes it easy to suspend your disbelief. \n I could not quite give it a complete 5-star because I had a few frustrations. The book is written from Mary\'s point of view only, which is not necessarily a bad thing normally, except that here you just cannot figure out what the heck is going on. It\'s a little like watching Lost, I flipping loved the show but there were just too many unanswered questions. I could list a whole bunch of ""Why did....s"" here but it would be too spoilery so I won\'t. Many things are unknown and never answered. \n I have read in the reviews here that some people find Mary\'s character unlikeable and frustrating. I have to defend her. The kid is seriously damaged and has a freaky upbringing. She is completely surrounded by walking dead people, the Sisterhood is running the show, and her family is pretty much dysfunctional or dead. She is not in control of her life in any way, and she experiences terrible tragedy after terrible tragedy. And yet everyone wants her to perkily skip through the forest and blow kisses at the dead people and jump into the first cute guy\'s arms that comes her way.

The title is wonderful and poetic, and (machine knit sweater aside) the cover is beautiful. After the book came out the reviews made me hesitant to read it, but when it was put into my hands with the instructions of 'read it' I didn't see a reason not too. \n As it turns out it wasn't bad. It moves along at a smart clip, has a interesting world that's chilling at its best, and strong emotional scenes early on. On the downside there are lots of little details that threw me out of the story, including the characters just plain acting dumb. The isn't so much a plot as there is a series of events - the end of the book could be the end of a chapter - and the major questions (what caused the zombies? what secrets are the sisterhood hiding? which love interest will she choose?) are either unanswered, or avoided completely by taking the choice out of the heroine's hands. Parts of it reminded me of The Village. \n At about the halfway point I stopped caring what would happen, mostly because it was pretty obvious how things would unfold. I keep going because the pace was quick and smooth and it wasn't any effort to finish the book. Probably the thing that dragged down the novel the most for me was all the unnecessary relationship drama, which was the actual focus of the story. It made the zombies seem less threatening that the heroine was more concerned about who loved whom. \n All in all it isn't bad, but it was disappointing. Perhaps made more disappointing because of how promising it was and how well it was hyped. In context of a debut book I'm willing to be forgiving. I won't be seeking out the sequel, but if it's handed to me like this one was I'd read it.""",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best.

Harry was...Harry. Boring. Travis was also equally boring and surprisingly WEAK. Jed was an asswipe. They make me all gag. \n And Mary? Wow, was she HORRIBLE. She\'s only driven by a childish dream and, really, it\'s annoying. There are people who listen to her because she thinks she knows things. She leads people on and leaves them in danger. Most of the time, all I ever read about her thinking about is, ""Look, something happened to Gabrielle, I like Travis and I want to go to the beach."" I truly hate her. \n She also thinks about what the Roman numerals mean, but only sporadically. I\'m just wondering -- isn\'t that supposed to be a big thing? \n The only people are like: \n 1) Gabrielle - she makes a kick-ass zombie \n 2) Sister Tabitha - although she\'s creepy, she DOES manage to hold off zombie Gabrielle and a bunch of other zombies \n 3) Argos - he\'s not technically human, but I just love dogs \n 4) the guy Mary meets when she washes up somewhere - he\'s cool because he kills zombies with a spade \n 5) Beth - I just feel sorry for her \n I mean, the ending isn\'t that good either.

I find it incredibly hard to relate to her, since even in my grief I never did anything completely stupid or life endangering. \n Mary is the protagonist and she has never seen the ocean. Her desire to see the ocean due to her mother\'s stories about the ocean... are basically 90% of what motivates her in the story. There isn\'t anything wrong with that, but I think perhaps her character is meant to be mentally unstable. She lost her mother and father to zombies, her brother treated her like garbage and was all ""GET THEE TO A NUNNERY"" on her ass, AND to top it all off her best friend, Cass, was going to marry the love of her life, Travis. \n The story loses a clear focus as it seems not enough attention was given to the elements in the first half of the book. What was the sisterhood up to? Why did they make a super zombie and then let it into the wild? Why did the village with reinforced doors succumb to the zombie attack so quickly? Why were the two buildings inhabited empty with no zeds to be found laying in wait? There are plenty of other plot holes, but these were the biggest to me. \n The writing is great otherwise.

They were scary, they were bloodthirsty and vicious. \n However, that's pretty much all I liked about this book. \n ~~Spoilers ahead~~ \n The main character, Mary, was so incredibly unlikeable. Short of shoving down her friends in the middle of a zombie circle, she does every possible thing to put them in danger, constantly. For what, you ask? For her desire to see the ocean, a need so deep it ends up killing(probably, although we don't get to see all of it) all her friends and her brother. \n She's careless, weak and borderline suicidal a couple of times. \n Next off we have the love triangle, without which the book could've done so much better, mainly because it didn't even feel real. We have two, seemingly, nice guys who love her more than anything, with no real explanation or apparent reason as to why. \n I cared more about what happened to them than I did about our so called heroine. And that's something because even though this book is not just about her, but about their group trying to survive, I didn't feel like we ever got to know them. \n Most of the time, it felt the rest of the characters were just written in as either in support of her mad desires and dreams or there to shut them down. Like it never really mattered what happened to them in the end. \n Also, so many questions are left unanswered. Who were They? What was this disease that made the zombies? What was up with the Sisterhood and all the secrets they kept? Why? Etc. Almost like by the end of the book, the author forgot about them and focused solely on getting Mary to the beach, plot be damned! \n Still, I gave this book 3 stars for the brilliant way in which it describes this zombie apocalypse and Mary's craziness.""",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths.

At first I was not going to read it because I thought it was a book based in past times and too dull. Whoa..nope it\'s not dull. These poor people never get a moment to rest! There is a BAM almost every time they close their eyes! \n So, I do have one HUGE issue with this book, and it appears it is why people call Mary all kinds of names, including selfish. Which I find VERY odd! OK, so I am a romantic at heart- I LOVE love! I am the go to the highest mountain, do anything for those I love, people or animals type of person- I am VERY unselfish in life and in love. I give it 120%! OK- now back to the book! ;) What I cannot understand is why a woman author is having a poor girl say she is SELFISH for wanting something more than just a man??? I mean..what one of us would be fulfilled if all we did was have a man and stay at home??? Sure some women, that IS their dream- But it is usually the kids that are their dream- not always the man- I am cool with that! But I know many housewives who are miserable and unfulfilled- Our world is about more than just raising kids. We are supposed to help others. So I have a lot of dreams. As do many..it doesn\'t mean I don\'t want love- That was one of my dreams as well :) But I am not just going to sit at home and not want to fulfill other dreams- When we have our own lives that makes us BETTER and it makes us love even more- It doesn\'t take away! When we have our own goals, dreams etc and are our own person..how does that mean we don\'t love someone? A man or a woman shouldn\'t be our only goal in life! HA! How is it selfish that Mary had a dream? IT IS however selfish that those men wanted her to devote her life to them and didn\'t want to let her have her dream. Wow...seriously. Are we living in the BC times?lol. I rescue animals, want to help women and children etc etc etc. And I would never be with a man who wanted me to just stay home and do nothing with my life- I want to do something big in this world- And I expect a man who loved me would want to be by my side in it and help me pursue my dreams- Not hold me back! THAT is LOVE! Helping someone reach their dreams- It doesn\'t take away from your love for them at ALL! But it does if you are telling someone to give up their dreams- I am not talking about some workaholic type either- But many of us have dreams- Why can\'t we have love and a life too?? \n Mary isn\'t selfish- She just wants a life beyond love- Beyond get up, play with my child, go to bed. How is that selfish? Those men are selfish- They wanted her to give up on her dream. THAT is selfish. It was making me want to drive my nails down the wall to keep hearing the men say ""I should be enough"" What??? Well that isn\'t love if you just expect someone to have no life and focus 100% on you. That is unhealthy. Someone can still love you like twilight love but also have a life and accomplish things too. It just helps you love MORE even because you are getting to have a life and fulfill your dreams too. Any man or woman who really loves you will be HELPING you and wanting you to reach your dreams and live a fulfilled LIFE! That is REAL LOVE. Selfish love was what the men in this book were doing- Expecting her to focus 100% on them and have no dreams outside of them. Ridiculous! If THEY loved HER they would have been trying to help her reach her dreams, not trying to guilt her into having none. They knew this was her dream. Why on earth can\'t she have love and life??? Love and her dreams and goals? Silly! \n OK so...!!!LOL! This book was great. Beyond the one basis that I truly despised about life and love- The book was good and I was SO disappointing and shattered that the second book did not leave off where this one did :((( I would have liked to see what happened to some others in the book and if she went back for them etc- But I guess maybe it does have some parts in the dead tossed waves- I will probably read it tonight but I couldn\'t last night. I was too disappointed it didn\'t leave off in Mary\'s story :( And please lord let her have found a man who is unselfish. She is not- She never left anyone behind and helped everyone even if it meant sacrificing herself- She is NOT selfish- She made sure to help everyone and get them safe and she never wanted Travis or anyone put in danger or to sacrifice themselves. She was not selfish just because she wanted a life outside of love!!'",3.59,"In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve.

For the umpteenth time her mother and her move again, this time to a new flat in London and she isn't happy about it at all because she started putting down roots the last time they moved. In fact, her best friend Olivia, comes with them to help them out for the next two weeks and that is pretty much the only thing that Gwen is happy for. But eventually she knows that Liv is going back home and she'll be stuck here with her mother who believes that the fairy mural painted in the second bedroom in their new flat is real and that they are watching her. \n On the first night, Gwen is awoken by something moving in the shadows and making noises, she thinks it's just a draft of some sort, until a hand clutches over her mouth and lifts her up and out of her room. After a freaky light show, some flying, and possibly a cannon fight, Gwen finds herself falling into water and losing consciousness. When she wakes up she is on board a ship and its Captain welcomes her to the last place she ever thought possible. Neverland. Only this isn't the land from the stories and Captain isn't the villain he is made out to be. Pan, on the other hand, just might be the villain and he wants Gwen no matter the cost. \n So Maxwell had a lot to live up to with her rendition of Hook, and she did come close to beating Killian, but she fell just a little bit short. The first few chapters were a little slow and didn't give too much information, but once Gwen drops into Neverland the pace picks up and the witty conversation flies.""",3.57,"For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home--all because her mother believes that monsters are hunting them.

But when Gwen and Olivia are kidnapped by shadowy creatures and taken to a world of flesh-eating sea hags and dangerous Fey, Gwen realizes her mom might have been sane all along.
The world Gwen finds herself in is called Neverland, yet it's nothing like the stories. Here, good and evil lose their meaning and memories slip like water through her fingers. As Gwen struggles to remember where she came from and find a way home, she must choose between trusting the charming fairy-tale hero who says all the right things and the roguish young pirate who promises to keep her safe.

Authors need to retain just enough of the original story to make readers feel comfortable and familiar with the story, but they need to add enough spin to their version to make it their own. After all, it is supposed to be a retelling, not a rehash of the 'same old, same old'. Lisa Maxwell's Unhooked, a retelling of Peter Pan of sorts, does a great job with finding this very delicate balance between the two must-have elements in a fairytale retelling. \n Unhooked grabs readers and takes them away to a very dark, gritty Neverland. Here you find magic, adventure, and the ability to fly around, but there is an undertone of darkness. And of course, living on the island comes with a cost - you start to lose yourself, your past memories, and pretty much you have to sacrifice everything from your former life. \n Upon starting Unhooked, there is a slight feeling of confusion. Maxwell doesn't necessarily throw readers into the action, but there are a lot of secrets and untold stories. This gives readers the sense that they are missing something or something was left out. It wasn't left out, as all things slowly start to come together, but it can be very confusing especially if you are expecting a complete Peter Pan knockoff. \n Maxwell adds several different twists to the story to make it her own. There are dark faeries, a battle for the island, Pan is not at all like the Disney version (even though he tries to act that way at first), and Hook has a very interesting backstory that forces readers to look at him in a completely different light. \n I really enjoyed the twist Maxwell added to the Peter Pan story. After the initial slow/confusing start, the story really took on a life of its own. It was fun to see how Maxwell took some of the original fairytale/Disney version and twisted it to give it a unique angle. \n However, despite this novel being what I would consider a fairytale retelling done right, it is not without its flaws. Gwen, our main heroine and who is responsible for telling us the story, is a bit frustrating as a character. There were times when she would act incredibly strong and independent, but then just as quickly she'd be a wishy-washy character who couldn't make up her mind. It almost seemed like if she was supposed to think for her own, she wouldn't and times where she didn't need to think for herself she'd start exerting some level of control over the situation. \n I personally would have liked to see Gwen grow a bit more as a character. Unfortunately, she seemed to just glide through the story and let other people/situations tell her what to do. \n Another slight flaw was the world-building. Neverland was this mysterious dark world and while readers are given a glimpse into that world, it never really felt like it was enough. I would have loved the romance aspect toned down and more focus on Neverland. \n That leads me to the romance. Unhooked had unexpected romance thrown into it. While I understand the importance of romance, it seemed forced and almost overtook the story. There is a budding romance between Gwen and Hook, it almost bordered on the insta-love. Then there was this odd romance between Pan and Olivia (Gwen's best friend who got taken to Neverland). Olivia would get jealous of Gwen whenever Pan looked/talked to Gwen. \n The romance does play a role in the plot and adds an element to the story, but I would have liked to see more time devoted to character development (either Gwen or Pan) or developing the world of Neverland. \n Even though it is not a perfect book, it is a satisfying read. Upon completion of Unhooked, I felt like I read a solid, complete standalone novel. There were certainly enough twists and turns to keep me entertained and reading, and the ending wasn't fully what I thought would happen, but I wasn't disappointed in it. \n I would recommend Unhooked to those who enjoyed Peter Pan and are looking for a new spin on the old classic story. Those who are looking for a quick fantasy read will also enjoy it too, as will anyone who likes fairytale retellings.""",3.57,"For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home--all because her mother believes that monsters are hunting them.

I've tried starting a number of books such as The Lost Boys and Second Star but I've never been able to get past a few chapters. Unhooked, on the other hand, just got me hooked (no pun intended). \n Seeing as I've never finished a Peter Pan retelling before, I'm not fit to judge the originality of this retelling. However, as I was reading it, it felt very unique. What I really loved about this novel is how the roles they (Pan, Hook and the others) play are not so black and white. Even until the end, there were still surprises, and I just loved that in this book. There are times when that gets annoying, but the author made it work with this one. Plus points, too because the author was able to make it work in a retelling in which we are supposed to know what happens. \n Despite my bad history with Peter Pan retellings, I'm just so glad that I felt so compelled to request this, because it's one of the most enjoyable retellings I've read in a while. It was almost perfect. And ahh, the romance! There was so much tension and so much feels, and I just loved it! Gosh, I don't even know how to put all my feelings into words about how amazing the romance in this book is! \n Through this novel, Lisa Maxwell has created a whole new Neverland where everything is grey and nothing is black or white. Clever, gripping and moving, this one is truly worth the read!""",3.57,"For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home--all because her mother believes that monsters are hunting them.

She wants nothing else than to hang out with her bestie, Olivia.

Instead, we focus on Gwen who is not the most interesting character of all. \n I must say that this book had so much potential. Unfortunately, the focus and the characters did not fill it up for me.

Now these delusions have brought them to London, far from the life Gwen had finally started to build for herself. The only saving grace is her best friend, Olivia, who's coming with them for the summer.
But when Gwen and Olivia are kidnapped by shadowy creatures and taken to a world of flesh-eating sea hags and dangerous Fey, Gwen realizes her mom might have been sane all along.

Welcome to the land of Adarlan where the world has been stripped of all its magic and the word magic has been banned by the king. Over there is the city of Endovier that also contains a labor camp where all the prisoners who haven't been killed are sent to work the salt mines. In this camp is a girl of eighteen who is notorious. Her name is Celaena, but others just call her Adarlan's Assassin. It's for this girl that the Crown Prince of Adarlan - Dorian - and the Captain of his guard - Chaol - come to Endovier for. Dorian's father is hosting a competition for someone to become the King's Champion and Dorian wants to sponsor her. He believes that she can win if what he's heard about her is true. Happy for the chance at freedom she accepts. \n Dorian takes her to the glass palace where she meets the other competitors, most of whom are fellow criminals, but instead of going by her name Dorian and Chaol introduce her as Lady Lillian a jewel thief from the neighboring country. They don't want to draw too much attention to her. However, it doesn't quite matter because even though there are Tests prepared to eliminate those who aren't worthy, there are mysterious murders too. The day of a new Test, a body of competitor is found and Chaol is having a hard time trying to figure out what is going on. Celaena starts to pick up on some of the mystery and does her own investigation but what she discovers she can't believe. How is it possible for this sort of magic to still exist? \n She doesn't know and wants to find out but there are people out there - spies, her fellow competitors, those close to the king - who are bent on making sure that she doesn't find out until it's too late.""",4.23,"Meet Celaena Sardothien.

After a year of brutal treatment, she is offered an opportunity for freedom by none other than Prince Dorian: if she can win a competition to become the King\'s Champion, and serve him for four years, she will have her freedom. Killing, even for the king who crushed her people, is better than being whipped and beaten, so Celaena takes the chance. As she regains her strength and tries not to appear too intimidating to the other competitors (not than most of them take a girl seriously anyway), she discovers an evil plot in the glass palace. Someone is using forbidden magic to kill off the competitors. Is it scheming Kaltain who wants the prince for herself? Is it the foreign princess Nehemia? Perhaps it is the king himself, or the top competitor, Cain? Celaena isn\'t sure about that. What she is sure about is falling for both Prince Dorian and the man assigned to guard her, Chaol. \n First off, let me just say that I had the song ""Heart of Glass"" stuck in my head for the duration of reading this book. \n Second, I did not expect to like this as much as I did! I\'m not a huge fan of fantasy, but I liked this female assassin immediately. Celaena was a firecracker to be sure, and deadly, but she also actually cared about people. I didn\'t much expect to like either the prince or Chaol at first, and now I\'m about as torn as Celaena, and generally I dislike love triangles... I also liked that Celaena had other friendships throughout that weren\'t part of her love triangle. The world building somehow didn\'t interfere with the plot (no giant info dumps!) and I\'m very curious about the rebellion and the Wyrdmarks.

If anything, I love it even more each time. \n Dessen at her absolute best. \n Updated July 2015 \n The most common complaint about Sarah Dessen is her classic formulaic stories that have become, well, her trademark. Her signature novel, usually a coming of age story, consists of: family dysfunction, a dash of romance and self discovery, often over the course of a summer, through the perspective of a likeable and relatable heroine. BOOM--Classic Dessen. \n While I can certainly agree to an extent with the above, all the above is also everything I enjoy in a YA novel, so no complaints here from a forever loyal Dessen fangirl. \n But to everyone who believes that all her novels are the same, every book a repetition of the last, well, I don\'t think you\'ve read this one. I appreciate every MC she\'s given us thus far, however similar or interchangeable you may find them, but Remy is nothing at all like the others. \n Like I said, I\'m a huge Dessen fan and I love every work of hers published, but I truly believe this is Sarah at her absolute best. Remy is complicated, stubborn, cynical, what many would even call ""unlikeable"" which is what makes her my favorite of all. Not only does her authenticity ring true on every page and in every bit of dialogue, but there\'s just something about the way the story is written that makes it stand out amongst the others. Dessen just has a knack for off-handedly describing something so trivial in such an insightful way that hits you, resonating so deeply with you, you find yourself bookmarking pages and passages or committing the wording to memory because you realize it\'s a feeling you\'ve always felt but could never put into words or never even thought to put into words before. \n The romance is also unconventional, especially by Dessen standards. The love interest here is Remy\'s total opposite; he\'s quirky, easygoing, silly and lovable. Above all, he\'s a musician aka a deal breaker. In most novels even outside of Dessen\'s, we\'re given a totally perfect boy. Tall, dark and handsome; the ideal. And while I love to swoon over a Ken as much as the next girl, there\'s just something enticing and exciting and heartwarming about watching a reluctant girl fall in love with the person she least expects. (I\'m all for that trope ANY day!) \n I reread This Lullaby annually, preferably in the summer and will continue to do so, however, this year marked ten years since I discovered this book. I was fourteen years old and instead of getting an allowance like most of my friends would, my mom would take my brother and I to the mall or wherever and let us pick out something for our good behavior (yeah right) or mostly so we would keep occupied and stop nagging 24/7. Usually I\'d go with those 3-pack magazine bundles of Tiger Beat, J-14 and Teen Bop along with a CD (I wanted to be a magazine editor at this time) but after browsing the magazine and music section at Target, I was annoyed I had already gotten every anticipated new release earlier that month. So I wandered into the book section. I\'d always been a reader, but junior high is evil and, well, I hadn\'t picked up a book in a while but something about two covers I saw on the shelf drew my attention. The first one pictured two pairs of feet on the beach, the other a hand holding a flower petal(?..idk) (YA covers have come a long way since 2005, huh?). I read the back of both and after much contemplation, I picked up This Lullaby. It didn\'t occur to me until a few years later as I was thinking back on that off-chance of me wandering in the book isle that I probably could have gotten both. (My mom def wouldn\'t have discouraged it.) And, well, the rest is history. \n This might seem stupid or kind of weird to some of you, but this is one of the most vivid moments in my life that I can recall and that I\'m thankful for--unknowingly picking up what would become my absolute favorite book for the very first time. It\'s a good memory to have anyway. Had I picked up Someone Like You instead that day, I undoubtedly still would have discovered and loved This Lullaby but the fact that I hadn\'t and that by chance (or fate), this was my first Dessen book, the introduction to a crucial part of my adolescence, makes it all the more special to me. \n I didn\'t set out to write this much (embarrassing!), I only figured I\'d write not necessarily a review, but jot some of my thoughts and feelings down for this book, something to commemorate this story that has been with me from my fourteen years to my now (almost) twenty-four year old self. \n If you haven\'t read This Lullaby yet, I obviously suggest you do. If you\'re reluctant to because of previous Dessen works that weren\'t your thing, try it anyway. Who knows, it could very well end up becoming your favorite book too.'",4.03,"There is an alternate cover edition for this ISBN13 .

This one, however, didn\'t really do it for me. I still love Dessen\'s writing style and her un-preachy attitude towards teens drinking and having sex. I was even OK with Remy\'s crabbiness toward guys, since it\'s grounded in her mother\'s string of failed marriages and general flightiness. But I just didn\'t believe anything about Dexter, and worse, I didn\'t like him. He shows his feelings for Remy by being creepy, stalker-y, and immature. Literally the only thing that makes his actions OK is that he somehow ""just knows"" he and Remy are going to end up together. She tells him ""no"" over and over and he just ignores her. I hate to be the one taking the ""what are we teaching our children??"" tack, but I just cannot get behind a book whose message is ""you\'ll know when you find THE ONE because he won\'t take no for an answer."" \n I also found the whole musician dad subplot troubling. I get that allowing Dexter to sing her dad\'s song represents Remy finally yielding the most private part of herself to Dexter, but the emotional impact that that change was supposed to have never really resonated with me. \n I do like stories like this, where a crabby jaded girl learns to take risks and let herself love again. But I really wish Dessen had found a way for Dexter to break down Remy\'s defenses that was a little more respectful of her boundaries.'",4.03,"There is an alternate cover edition for this ISBN13 .

Her lifelong friend, student revolutionary Yates, urges her to run to freedom across the border to Canada. As their friendship turns to passion, the decision to leave becomes harder and harder. Running away is incredibly dangerous, and it's possible Avie will never see Yates again. But staying could mean death.

I really like it. Very pretty. Nice contrast. You can easily tell which type of readers they are targeting. \n Catherine Linka does a great job of evoking reader\'s emotion. Honestly, I was so upset at the book that I nearly strangle its invisible neck. The book does bring up issues on feminism and other such topics like politics and anti-government. Well, not exactly anti-government. We can just say that this book is a perfect example of what happens when the government gets things wrong. Eh... Near perfect. It is not exactly perfect. Besides, there is a more peaceful way of ending these issues in the book. Uniting all the girls together and marching to Washington D.C. \n But let\'s pretend those options don\'t exist. Let\'s pretend those options don\'t exist to the point that these people, these characters, need to turn to violence. That is what A Girl Called Fearless does. \n Basically, this book turns United States into a similar place to what some countries in the Middle Eastern are like. Oh, yeah. Girls can\'t drive. Girls stay home. Girls don\'t have education. Honestly, I pretty much figured out that I\'m a feminist and that I really hate staying at home and not having an education. And I figured out that I can spend ten pages just ranting on the inequality and unfairness of the government in this book (which degrades woman to the point where they are just like cattle and property). It is as if the Woman\'s Rights Movement took a huge step backwards. \n Yeah, I\'m spending way too much time ranting on anti-feminism. Where was I? Oh, yes. The book. \n Honestly, when it comes to Avie Reveare, I just want to bang her head and shout, ""Kill them all!"" But I like her, actually. She isn\'t a strong character at first, but she grows very well. I don\'t approve very much on her love interests, but... That is a much different situation, which is not as severe as the anti-feminism movement. \n Overall, A Girl Called Fearless is a great book. You might hate a lot of the characters (because they are all against girl power), but it is entertaining. For certain. \n And there is probably going to be a lot of debate. Especially among the girls. \n Rating: Four out of Five \n -ofpaperandwords.blogspot.com'",3.83,"An Indie Next Pick!
Avie Reveare has the normal life of a privileged teen growing up in L.A., at least as normal as any girl's life is these days. After a synthetic hormone in beef killed fifty million American women ten years ago, only young girls, old women, men, and boys are left to pick up the pieces. The death threat is past, but fathers still fear for their daughters' safety, and the Paternalist Movement, begun to ""protect"" young women, is taking over the choices they make.

'rock' is a good young adult book, mature, well structured, tense and nailbittingly romantic but it's not quite a masterpiece.

I could live and in fact, I could support not naming names and foregoing labels but I found it odd that the issue was set up so neatly and then kinda left by the wayside even in times of great anxiety and stress.

Tears, laughter and pure speechlessness! \n So glad I again trusted my friends recommendation and ""Kindled the crap out of it ASAP. "" and I especially should have listened when she told me to grab the tissues! \n The story begins with a family breaking up and the kids trying to reconcile the new life they were leading and accepting a new side to their family whilst forgiving their dad in the process. If that wasn\'t emotional enough then we have the beautiful quiet rock loving Cooper discovering his true self and being strong enough to share that with his family. And what a family.... \n Coming out to his sister who just told Coop to embrace life and be himself and then to his wonderful mum. I don\'t think anyone can make it through the cookie scene without tears. ""Ill always be your biggest fan..no matter what play you make"". \n And lets have a shout out for Bert and Ernie, lovable idiots. The way they handled the realization and resulting school reaction to Cooper\'s sexuality was great. To just ignore the world and make the world a stage for Cooper was just beautiful. Friendship is acceptance and these boys displayed it wonderfully, albeit with questionable dance moves! \n Despite all this acceptance we still had to watch coop struggle through his feelings and loving Jace from afar. So many beautiful moments between them and you just wished the world would fade away so they could get it together. \n How could you not feel for these boys, watching them grow together then grow apart was heartbreaking. ""I\'ll be your rock"", ""I would choose you"" and when Jace sung to Coop. Just too much! \n It was hard to see Coop go on without Jace but thankfully good things happen to those who wait. And Cooper put it beautifully when he said ""i can. I have I always will"". It took longer than you would\'ve hoped but time and life made \n Them realize just how much they needed one another how much they were a part of each others existence. \n The book was told from Coopers perspective so to hear from Lila that in Coopers absence Jace would curl up in bed with a stone just gave you insight to the struggle Jace was going through as well. To know his mum accepted and support his choices was necessary and evidenced when he showed her the opal, a stone as beautiful and as complex as the love these two share! \n Now excuse me whilst I go and re-read some passages this time with a tissue in hand... \n Thankyou Anyta for sharing such a beautifully written telling of age story with us!'",4.23,"Igneous.

I thought I might even end up hating it. But what do you know! I actually want to run around hugging and kissing it right now. Throne of Glass was absolutely engrossing on so many levels! \n Although the start was slightly slow for me and the romance between Dorian and Celaena seemed kind of... insta-love-ish, the mystery, intrigue, action and witty dialogues were just too amazing to make me ponder much about the tiny issues that bugged me. \n Firstly, Celaena. I would admit I was confused by her personality at the start. Was she lethal, girly, or smart? Somehow, I had the mentality that she should have an 'assassin' attitude and personality. However, I understood her better as the story progressed. Being 'Adarlan's Assassin' was simply a skill of Celaena's that she was forced to hone to perfection. I honestly doubt she would've chosen to be an assassin if she hadn't been forced into the trade. \n That was exactly what I loved about Celaena. She didn't let her 'career' define her. The fact that she's multi-faceted made her so realistic because honestly, who on Earth ever have a definite personality that can be labelled so neatly? I found myself relating to Celaena a lot - my love for reading, girly stuff, sarcasm and badass-ness - and it's really admirable, how Sarah J. Maas dared to defy the mainstream 'lethal heroines can't be girly and sassy' cliche. I understand some people might not be used to such a colorful character and become puzzled with Celaena's personality, like I did in the beginning, but in the end, I undoubtedly feel Sarah J. Maas created a wonderfully life-like protagonist here. \n As for the romance, I was sort of expecting something along the lines of a 'pick-me-and-hate-him' love triangle. I feel a little bad at the low expectations I had for Throne of Glass because actually, Chaol, the Captain of the Guard, and Dorian, the Crown Prince, were childhood friends and amazing individuals. Although I had issues with the insta-love involved in Dolaena, I utterly loved Chaolaena. Their relationship was so subtle and adorable. Moreover, the witty banter involved in both relationships are simply hilarious and shipping FEELS inducing. \n Which do I ship? Well, I like both guys but I would say I lean a little more towards Chaol. Dorian's awesome, but Chaol just seem to have this masculine aura that girls like me can't resist. ;) \n Moving on to the plot and storyline, it was wholly enjoyable and had me on the edge of my seat. The whole thing going on with Wyrdmarks was extremely fascinating to me and although I could predict the characters involved in the murder of the other Champions, it was fun just following along with everything. Another aspect of the book which I loved was Sarah J. Maas's ability to bring a fantasy world to life. The whole atmosphere in the palace was so hauntingly well done, I can still picture the corridors and rooms in my head. Little mundane things in life were also brought in, making it so much easier to relate and step into the fantasy world. \n Overall, I'm just enamored with Throne of Glass. Fantastically written with realistic and imperfect characters (Celaena did admit to using makeup to enhance her blander features before being sent to Endovier), a beautifully brutal world and impeccable pacing, Throne of Glass is one of the best YA fantasies I've read to date. It has got everything I would like in a fantasy novel - action, world-building, a kickass protagonist, fun romance, evil, intrigue and a fascinating plot. If you could see me right now, I would be jumping and yelling at you to pick up this book now!""",4.23,"""Nothing is a coincidence. Everything has a purpose.

Her grandfather never gave up on trying to find his beloved father. He went crazy, or so she and everyone thought. \n Not a bad book. I felt that the author, Rachel Carter, could have describe the events in So Close To You in greater detail. Cassandra Clare did a well job of that in City of Bones, City of Ashes, City of Glass, City of Fallen Angels, City of Lost Souls, Clockwork Prince, Clockwork Angel, and Clockwork Princess. (Or Cassandra Clare did a well job of that in every book she has wrote, for those who don\'t read Cassandra Clare and has no idea what the hell am I talking about). \n The mysterious boy... I like how the author talks about him. However, I felt that, like the events, he could have been describe in much greater detail. Then he would be unbelievably hot. The girls would never take their hands of So Close To You, like City of Bones and City of Fallen Angels and City of Lost Souls. (Not kidding, one girl I knew wouldn\'t let go of her copy of City of Lost Souls because of how obsessed she was). \n The mysterious boy... I wished he had more of an appearance in So Close To You. He appears only when he feels like it. If he appeared a little more, then he will have a greater impact on the readers. Anyway, the mysterious boy is a child time traveler. (He\'s only seventeen.) He is knowledgeable about the enemy of Lydia. He is in fact once upon a time one of them. (So this book is turning these two into starcrossed lovers. Wonderful.) \n Lydia... I can\'t tell you whether she is reckless and insane or stupid and confident. Neither of those options look good on her profile. Lydia, despite all those warnings, messes with people\'s business. She tries to change everything, but ended up making it much worse. \n Project Montauk is real. The project is a time traveling machine. The mysterious boy is part of the project. He\'s one of the few time traveler. Only children under eighteen can travel in the time traveling machine. Any older persons will be severely injured and mentally insane. It\'s a very pleasant journey for the older people right? *Shakes head* \n The plot... I love the ending, the most. Despite all the hardships and horrible events, Lydia makes the killing choice. People she loves get hurt really badly and she still made that choice. She had two choices, stopping her younger self from going into the machine or letting her younger self go into the machine and travel to the past. Guess what choice she made. \n The ending... It killed me too. I slam the book close and was tempted to throw it because of the ending. UGH!!! I hate the ending. \n SPOILERS! \n The mysterious boy is shot and assumed dead. \n Lydia lets her former self go into the machine and change time because of her love for the mysterious boy. \n Her great-grandfather was missing. When Lydia came back to the present, her grandfather was missing instead of her great-grandfather. \n Her father adopted the behavior of her grandfather after Lydia changed time. \n END SPOILER!! \n This book\'s rating is a four out of five. \n This review is also on myblog.'",3.75,"LYDIA BENTLEY has heard stories about the Montauk Project all her life: stories about the strange things that took place at the abandoned military base near her home and people who've disappeared over the years.

Kelsey and Issac are characters that we've seen before. It was nice to have both there perspectives on what happens in the story because we got to see how the problem affected both of them personally. We got to see in both of their lives and how they live it. Each one at struggles, triumphs and the hits that pushed them over the edge. \n My biggest let down was the ending. We had this big build up to something huge. However, when it did explode, there was nothing huge. It fell flat for me because the big thing wasn't so big. I have to say, that I have seen worse.

I have to be in the right mood to read a dystopian/science fiction/fantasy/other type of world, because I prefer contemporary and the different rules in new worlds sometimes don't mesh well with me. I watched The Story Siren's In My Mailbox last week and she mentioned Eve and how she was excited to read it - and something just clicked with me. I picked it up that night. \n Not really knowing what to expect, I ended up getting a lot more. Eve is a story of a world where a virus/plague takes out so much of the population that a new king is elected. He vows to build the country back up - and in the process sets up schools for orphans, where Eve has lived for most of her life. She finds out the real purpose of the orphan schools, and goes on the run. \n My favorite part about Eve (the book, not the girl) is that Anna Carey is not afraid to write the hard scenes. Everything does not work out perfectly for any of the characters - in fact, it's not even close to perfect - and that makes the story more real (and more thrilling) to read. It's nearly impossibly to guess what could be coming next - in fact, there are three books planned for this series, and while I know how the first book ends, I have no idea where Carey will take us in the next two, and that makes it very exciting. \n Eve grows as a character quite a bit throughout this book as well. Growing up at her orphan all girls school, she is taught many things about men that are not necessarily true, and you can see how much it skews not only her relationships, but the books she has read, her ambitions in life, etc etc. I had to remind myself many times that she reacts certain ways because she was taught to do so - Eve's thoughts and actions remain genuine to her upbringing. \n An exciting, thrilling first book of a trilogy, EVE will keep you reading as you discover the world along with Eve.""",3.69,"The year is 2032, sixteen years after a deadly virus--and the vaccine intended to protect against it--wiped out most of the earth's population. The night before eighteen-year-old Eve's graduation from her all-girls school she discovers what really happens to new graduates, and the horrifying fate that awaits her.
Fleeing the only home she's ever known, Eve sets off on a long, treacherous journey, searching for a place she can survive. Along the way she encounters Caleb, a rough, rebellious boy living in the wild. Separated from men her whole life, Eve has been taught to fear them, but Caleb slowly wins her trust...and her heart.

I\'m scared of losing memories forever, scared of not having that person in my life at all.. even as a memory. \n This book is an amazing healing tool. To be honest, I don\'t think people really ever ""heal"" from major losses. But we patch ourselves up, and we keep moving on, we keep living.. because what they say is true: Life goes on... even when we don\'t want it to. \n Highly recommend picking up this book, especially if you could use a little hope in your life... or just a reminder that your memories are yours, and no one else\'s to take away.'",3.84,"Girl meets boy.

I figured Prom and Prejudice would be based on the original, but I wasn't entirely sure what would happen since I didn't know anything about it. \n Turns out that the story is very similar to the original, all the way down to the names used for the characters - I read a synopsis of Pride & Prejudice when I was finished and was kind of astonished at how similar they were. Though, for all I know, this is how all adaptations are done. I mean, obviously some things were changed - our plot revolves around the prom, for example. I'm not sure how some people read adaptation after adaptation if they really are exactly the same, but we all like different things I guess :) \n I enjoyed myself throughout the story. It teaches the reader about prejudice (imagine that), and has a little bit of a complex storyline (what with all of the different relationships and families, anyway). I was actually sincerely shocked at one of the twists, which I think even those familiar with the original may find surprising (though maybe not, I'm not sure). Of course, I enjoy a good romance, and there is certainly a good amount of that in this book. Each of the characters had a distinctive personality, and I did really like Lizzie (our main character). \n Prom and Prejudice would be a great gateway to the actual novel it is based on. Introducing a younger reader to this shorter version would definitely intrigue them, as I myself have now considered reading the original classic, and would imagine many other readers may feel the same way!""",3.82,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single girl of high standing at Longbourn Academy must be in want of a prom date.

I have to confess that I haven\'t read ""Pride and Prejudice"" (I know I\'ve lost all credibility), but I figured I could give this book a chance. I wasn\'t really expecting much. The cover made it sound like a typical teen drama of misunderstanding and then reconciliation; at the end all of the characters are friends and everyone\'s happy and better off. \n This book ended up being much more than that. Although I\'m sure it pales in comparison to the real thing, I felt that this novel actually had substance and personality. I liked Lizzie, the main character, and she seemed like a real person. She definitely had flaws but she was also pretty nice. The other characters were well developed too with the exception of Lizzie\'s roommate,Jane. Jane was so nice and cloyingly sweet she reminded me of Melanie from ""Gone With the Wind."" Her character was just too darn clueless. How could she think so highly of everyone after the way so many people in the school treated her good friend? \n Also, some of the dialogue is a bit misleading? At first I was confused about the time period of the story. I thought it was modern day but then some character would say something like, ""so and so were smitten with each other"" and I\'d think maybe this is the 1800\'s. No self-respecting teenager, no matter how rich, smart or well-educated says ""smitten."" Have you ever heard Nate Archibald or Blair Waldorf say ""smitten?"" \n Oh well, over all this was an enjoyable story and had enough twists and unusual characters to keep it interesting.

I ended up having to read a spoilery review of Linger to get the gist of it all flowing the right way in my head again (so I strongly suggest you reread or do a little research before starting this one). \n Maggie Stiefvater's writing is simply beautiful. Even those that didn't care much for Shiver commented on how wonderful her writing is, and she does not disappoint in the final installment of The Wolves of Mercy Falls. It jumps us right to where Linger left off, and from there we are right back with Grace, Isabel, Sam, and Cole. \n The middle of Forever got a little long for me, but that's my only complaint. The last third of the book flew by and had my heart pounding. Steifvater doesn't use predictable outcomes to satisfy the reader, which was my favorite part - she wrote this book in a real, true way, and it resonated with me as a reader. \n It's not often that I love the last book in a series much much more than the others, but there is no denying that Forever surpasses both Shiver and Linger in my mind.""",3.91,"then.

But she doesn't close the deal on this series, and before anyone jumps on me as per the end of the book this IS the end of the series. \n So here's my problem. This book focused so much on Cole/Isabelle but I didn't care for them. There was so much focus on these two that the real love of Sam/Grace got lost in translation. \n After the whole lost love of Sam/Grace, you come up with the hundreds of questions that are left unsolved by this novel. Nothing is answered, in fact, more questions come up from this novel than anything else. For example, what is this cure? What happens to it? What happens with Grace and her parents or does she just leave them? What about school? NONE of this is described. \n There is so much time focused on the science part in the first book, and yet nothing is answered. Why are the wolves transforming in MN? Is MN the only place that has this problem? If not why are the other areas not dealing with deaths, etc?
